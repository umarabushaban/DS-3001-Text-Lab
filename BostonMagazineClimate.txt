Who's Behind the Barr Foundation
The organization seems to be everywhere â " driving Boston's agenda on climate change, the arts, and charter schools.
By Patti Hartigan
A lot can be learned when the NEA comes to town. 
In 1991--in the midst of the culture wars--U.S. Representative Chester Atkins ferried the National Endowment for the Arts director onatour designed to highlight the agency's good deeds around Boston.Afew years later, Senator Edward Kennedy did the same, accompanying the NEA chairwoman to an elementary school in Roxbury, where they sat on teeny chairs and watched adorable tots performaconcert. These official visits were as carefully choreographed asaSwan Lake solo, and featured our biggest-name elected officials in their snazziest suits. So something was decidedly different last May when NEA chairwoman Jane Chu arrived onawhistle-stop tour and the host was the wholly unelected Jim Canales, president of the Barr Foundation--the state's wealthiest and most influential privately funded philanthropy. Unlike previous visits, this time around the sights and speakers on the tour hadasingular theme: They all received generous funding from Barr. Sure, folks from City Hall and the state arts council were on hand, but the picture was clear: Barr is in control. 
Although the Barr Foundation has given out more than $710 million since 1999, chances are you've never heard of it. Until around 2010, donations were largely made on the condition of anonymity. Now that grants are given openly, Barr's influence is finally visible. Established29years ago by Amos and Barbara Hostetter, who founded Continental Cablevision, it started asakitchen-table family operation: Amos handled the investments, and Barbara managed the programs. In 2016, the foundation has assets totaling $1.6 billion andamandate to focus its philanthropic endeavors on Boston and the region. 
Now, suddenly, you can't turn around without coming across an organization or project bearing the Barr Foundation's stamp of approval. Barr is, after all--along with the Klarman Family Foundation--the funding muscle behind Boston Creates, the city's yearlong process to developacultural master plan. But the Barr Foundation's generous funding is not limited to the arts. It is equally indispensable in two other important arenas: education and climate change. Recently, for instance, it granted $5 million to Year Up,anonprofit that links young urban adults with educational and career opportunities. In climate change, Barr funds research studies as well as grassroots organizations such as the Massachusetts branch of the Clean Water Fund. You've rentedaHubway bike? Barr isapartner in that venture as well. 
Barr's influence, however, extends well beyond bikes on the streets all the way to City Hall and the State House. Barr Foundation money helped fund the search for Boston's new school superintendent, Tommy Chang, and several Barr fellows were on Mayor Marty Walsh's transition team. John Barros,aformer Barr fellow, is Walsh's chief of economic development, and Rahn Dorsey, Barr's former evaluation director, is the city's first chief of education. Barr also funds Go Boston 2030, the Walsh administration's initiative to redefine transportation in the city, and two Barr fellows withdrew from the program last year to join Governor Charlie Baker's administration. 
You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't credit the Barr for its enormous largesse, as the left-leaning charity funds causes that are dear to the city's liberal residents. But you would also be hard-pressed to findagrantee who will critique the foundation publicly. No big surprise there. Barr makes its grants by invitation only. Those who receive funding want to keep it, and those who don't want to get it. Like all foundations,"They tend to live inabubble of positivity,'' says Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy."They are surrounded by people who are predisposed to tell them whatever they want to hear." 
In private, though, many City Hall watchdogs, including some grantees, are questioning the kind of clout that Barr wields in public policy and city government."Private foundations--whether it be the Hostetter family or Bill and Melinda Gates or the Walton family from Walmart--can operate with impunity in perpetuity and can have enormous impact on public policy issues," says Alan Cantor,anonprofit consultant based in New Hampshire."With our elected leaders, we can unelect them, but we cannot get rid of the private philanthropists." 
If you enjoy your Hubway, your fine-arts organizations, and efforts to create universal early childhood education, you can thank cable television. Amos Hostetter,aself-made pioneer in the industry, sold his Continental Cablevision to U.S. West in1996for $10.8 billion. Today, he and his wife are worth some $3 billion, according to Forbes. The couple knew they wanted to use their new wealth to"do good," but unlike such current tech magnates as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, who broadcast their philanthropic efforts, the Hostetters choseaquieter route, starting what at first was called the Hostetter Foundation in 1987. Twelve years later, they changed the name of the foundation to Barr, after Amos Hostetter's middle name,asubtle way of keeping the family connection without grandstanding. 
The Hostetters are notoriously private. They live inamansion on Beacon Hill, butaclose associate says they didn't raise their three children--Caroline, Elizabeth, and Tripp--with silver spoons in their mouths. Caroline isanowaprincipal at the consulting firm the Parthenon Group; Elizabeth is pursuing an MBA at Harvard; and Tripp attended Duke University. They all share an interest in the foundation, but Barbara Hostetter says she wants them to build their own lives and careers. 
As newcomers to philanthropy, Amos and Barbara Hostetter didn't harbor delusions of grandeur, let alone pretend to know what they were doing."It's important to know when you start this work that there is no expertise in the house," Barbara says."We didn't start with being the smartest people in the room. We knew we hadagood learning curve ahead of us." 
But there was another reason they didn't pretend to know what they were doing."Humility," Barbara says softly, sitting inaconference room at the Pilot House, the waterfront property on Atlantic Avenue that is home to the Barr Foundation headquarters. The room affordsastunning view of the harbor, and the offices are well appointed without being ostentatious, with gleaming natural-wood floors, exposed beams, and brick walls. Barbara doesn't play the stock role ofapowerful magnate capable of changing the lives of those less fortunate. On the contrary, she is modest and contemplative, not so much guarded as reserved. As the last person to arrive for our interview in the conference room, she reluctantly sits at the head of the table, but it's clear she'd rather not be the center of attention. 
As they slowly built their foundation, the Hostetters hired staff members who knew how to direct funds to their targeted areas of interest. But the grant-giving remained largely anonymous, with the stipulation that grantees couldn't mention the foundation in marketing materials. In 2010, though, the Barr and its carefully guarded profile began to shift when the foundation boldly announced that it was directing $50 million over five years to fight climate change."It was an opportunity to use our voice," Barbara says. 
It was alsoaway of flexing some muscle to advance the couple's green agenda. But it's not just about money: It's about political clout and using power to forge public policy. Amos Hostetter is now cochair, along with Mayor Walsh, of Boston's Green Ribbon Commission,agroup of power players who advise the city on its Climate Action Plan."A foundation like Barr has two roles," says Robert Lynch, president and CEO of the advocacy group Americans for the Arts."The first is obviously giving out money. The second isapublic role, standing up there asaleader saying these are changes we believe in." 
Barbara gets it."We began to realize that we don't have the privilege of stepping back and doing the work anonymously," she says."We need to stand behind the work to leverage it and make it better." To do this, the Hostetters knew they needed the best and the brightest. Enter the foundation's new executive: Jim Canales. 
Canales's star had already risen by the time the Hostetters began recruiting him to be Barr's first president--and its third trustee, joining Amos and Barbara on the board--in 2014. As president and CEO of the James Irvine Foundation in San Francisco, he was at the helm ofa$2 billion philanthropic organization in sunny California, his lifelong home. The couple courted Canales, but he needed to be persuaded."His values are akin to our own," Barbara says, explaining why she and her husband pursued Canales."He believes in humility and collaboration and partnerships in philanthropy." 
After discussing the position with the Hostetters over lunch, it took two weeks for the Stanford University alum, who sits on the school's board of trustees, to accept the job. Ultimately enticed by the idea of not only leadingafoundation with deep pockets and community roots, but of reshaping it and refining its strategy, he says,"It wasasingular leadership opportunity." 
Canales embraces the Hostetters' commitment to humility, but carries himself withaforward-looking panache that the couple would be uncomfortable employing themselves. He knows how to workacrowd in both English and Spanish, and grew up in San Francisco withamother whose family is from Nicaragua andafather whose family is from Mexico. After graduating from Stanford withaBA in English and an MA in education by 1989, he worked asahigh school English teacher before entering philanthropy. Maybe that's where he developed his communication savvy. He joined the Irvine Foundation in 1993, rising to president10years later. After accepting the job at Barr, he moved to Boston with his husband, James McCann,adoctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. They live inacondo at Millennium Place, the Washington Street property that defines itself as"a new form of luxury urbanism." His total compensation last year wasashade over $700,000. 
As an outsider inatown not known for its fondness of strangers, Canales has quickly immersed himself in Boston's field of movers and shakers. He is cochair of the Boston Creates Leadership Council,agroup of roughly60arts leaders, donors, and civic leaders.Iwatched him dazzle them at one of the council's recent meetings, and he had no trouble coming up with anyone's name."The fact thatIamanewcomer here cuts both ways," he told me during an interview at the Barr offices."I havealot to learn, and the learning curve has been steep. On the other hand, you look at things withafresh perspective. You're not as anchored in the past." 
Driven by Canales's charisma and professionalism, Barr has burst onto the scene recently asapublic force. Canales hasareputation for his commitment to transparency in philanthropy, and he swiftly took steps to make the once-secretive foundation more public. He oversaw Barr's new website, withagrants database, staff blogs, and links to the foundation's tax returns, and establishedalively presence on social media."Foundations are increasingly realizing that they bring more to the table than resources," Canales says."One thing they bring is their voice. None of this is about self-aggrandizement. This is in service to the goals that we are trying to achieve." 
As part of his reboot, Canales rewrote the foundation's mission statement, which now defines the charity as"stewards and catalysts," and was charged with forginganew strategic planning effort that he is rolling out this winter."Evolution not revolution" is his mantra. The new planning effort, he says, is an attempt to refocus the foundation's work and to increase its impact, not to start from scratch and createa"shiny new object," as Canales puts it. The strategy includes extending Barr's reach beyond Boston withamore regional focus in all three of its program areas, as well as subtle shifts, such asanew attention to success in and beyond high school, and changing the name of its Arts & Culture program to Arts & Creativity. 
Canales has made other changes, too. As of this year, Barr will no longer invest money in what are known as donor-advised funds--controversial because, by law, donors do not have to reveal how the money was spent. For tax reasons, Barr has taken advantage of one of these funds: Out ofatotal grant budget of $47 million in 2010, it deposited $9.5 million in the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund. 
Private foundations are required by law to give away5percent of their assets annually--a requirement Barr meets in part thanks toacomplicated accounting system. This year's grant-making budget will increase to $70 million, up from $52 million in 2015. Critics such as David Callahan, founder and editor of Inside Philanthropy, point out Barr's enormous untapped potential, saying,"They are sitting onapile of money, with more waiting in the wings, but only deployingasmall fraction of it to solve huge problems like climate change.Iam waiting for them to swing for the fences." 
Asaresult, Barr is hardlyavanguard when it comes spending down its wealth. There isamovement in philanthropy called Giving While Living, founded by the duty-free-shopping titan Chuck Feeney, who gave the majority of his wealth to the New Yorkâ "based charity Atlantic Philanthropies. Feeney, along with Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bostonian Seth Klarman, are amongagroup of billionaires who signed what is known as the Giving Pledge,avow to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. The Hostetters are not among that group. Meanwhile, the John Merck Fund, also based in Boston and withafocus on environmental issues, is spending down all of its assets by 2021. 
Canales says that the trustees have decided to stay the course for now but have left the door open for future generations of trustees to spend down. The trustees have also decided to expand the three-person board. Initially, new members will not include the Hostetter children."It is not the best time of life for Mom and Dad to be pulling on your strings,'' Barbara says."There will beaplace for the family on the board, but it will not beamajority." Inanod to Canales, she adds,"We want it run professionally. We want the benefit of the smartest people in the field." 
There are two types of foundations: those that hand out the money and simply trust it will be put to good use; and those that design programs, fund them, and micromanage them. Barr is somewhere in between. 
Particularly in the arts, Barr is what many in the field describe as an active funder. Actor and playwright Daniel Beaty receiveda$350,000 grant over three years to work with Emerson College, using theater to address social issues. He says that Barr is openly involved in the process and that he, for one, appreciates the input."Sometimes whenIapproach foundations,Ifeel likeIam trying to figure out how to makeapart of myself fit intoabox of what they fund,'' he says."My experience [with Barr] was thatIwas able to speak about the wholeness of whoIam." 
Barr's recent strategy aims to engage new audiences, explore technology, and branch out into other sectors, such as arts and medicine. It will also expand outside Boston. The recent program name change--from Arts & Culture to Arts & Creativity--broadens the scope to include nontraditional and emerging forms of expression. 
Barr designs some programs to"incentivize certain kinds of behavior," its Arts & Culture senior program director, San San Wong, says. Some relish Barr's hands-on approach, describing it as iterative, not directive. But others privately fear that Barr prods institutions to further its agenda. Canales, naturally, disagrees."We have no desire to force any organization to redefine its work to fit our objectives," he says. 
Jeff Poulos, executive director of Associated Grant Makers, applauds the new transparency that Canales has created at Barr, but hopes for more openness in the grant-making process."If the process is truly by invitation only, the responsibility of the program officers is to get to know the work of as broadaspectrum of grantees as possible,'' he says."Their responsibility is to look beyond the usual suspects and to havealook at the full ecology of the city, as opposed to bringing in preconceived notions." 
When choreographer Peter DiMuro became executive director of the Dance Complex, in Cambridge, in 2013, he knew he had to raise money, but wasn't optimistic."After the economy tanked in 2008,Isaw arts funding shrivel up, like the witch's shoes under the house in The Wizard of Oz," he says. But then he got The Call from Wong. Afterayear of conversations, Barr gave the Dance Complexawhopping $500,000 grant to be used for operating support and renovations--and DiMuro went from having visions of the Wicked Witch of the East to feeling he had reached the Emerald City. 
Barr has not shied away from funding groups that take their mission to the streets. The Better Future Project,ayouthful advocacy organization that has been around for only five years, gets12percent of its $500,000 annual budget from Barr."We are the most grassroots of the groups they support," says executive director Craig Altemose,"and they appreciate the on-the-ground work and the marching in the streets and the raisingaruckus when things are not headed in the right direction." 
When it comes to climate change, Barr works locally rather than globally, and it ranks second only to Minneapolis's McKnight Foundation in its regional efforts. It will continue to expand its works under Canales's new strategy and funnel money toward key priorities--namely, creating livable, walkable communities, improving public transportation, promoting clean energy, and advocating for public policy that supports those efforts. The climate-change program will focus more heavily on building smart communities with easily accessible transportation options. 
Of course, progressive, bike-riding Bostonians are nearly unanimous in their support for green transportation and community arts programs, but residents are deeply divided over issues that may haveasubstantial impact on our city. The issue of charter schools, for instance, opens the newly transparent Barr up to scrutiny and connects the foundation to the third rail of Boston politics: school choice. Over the years, the foundation's reach in education has been broad, with generous grants to support early childhood education, career training, and afterschool programming. Both Canales and director of education Leah Hamilton say that Barr's education funding is"agnostic" and not driven by an agenda other than to achieve better outcomes for all students. But Barr has been generous to several charters, making public education advocates fear that the foundation is on the same path as such charities as the Gates and the Walton foundations, which have poured huge amounts of money into charter schools and are pushingadrive for public policy to support them. 
Members of the Citywide Parent Council and Quality Education for Every Student (QUEST)--two groups staunchly opposed to charters--are wary of Barr and its grant-making. They are highly critical of the Boston Compact,acoalition of charter, district, and parochial schools that is funded by Gates. Barr has paid out $150,000 to Boston Public Schools and Wheelock College to help establish the Compact here. The Compact is the driving force behind Boston's"unified enrollment" plan, which will change the way students are assigned to schools. Barr is also investing $5 million in the Fort Pointâ "based Boston Plan for Excellence (BPE), which runsanationally recognized teacher-training program as well asacharter school. These connections--combined with Barr's enormous wealth, influence, and political clout--raise fear and suspicion among parents and advocates who adamantly support public education over privatization."A small group withagreat deal of power and influence is shapingaplan with little input," says Mary Battenfeld,amember of QUEST and the Citywide Parent Council, and it"will radically restructure and possibly destroy Boston Public Schools." 
Canales, whose foundation helped bankroll the search for superintendent Chang, says he was not aware of the growing controversy, which has been getting louder and more heated as the debate over unified enrollment unfolds. He stands by the foundation's funding record, which includesadiverse portfolio in education grants, and he--like the advocates--is aware that funders must be very careful when investing in projects that affect people's lives. But advocates are concerned."The gap between the funders and these children is so wide,'' Battenfeld says."You have these funders who have so much money and live in suchadifferent world than the majority of those families. They are trying to determine policy for kids who they know nothing about." 
Breeze through the résumés of officials at City Hall, and you will find clear evidence of Barr. The city's first chief of education isaformer Barr director, and the chief of economic development isaformer Barr fellow. Canales talks regularly with city officials, says Joyce Linehan, Mayor Walsh's chief of policy, and Canales describes the foundation asa"constructive partner" with city government. During the2013mayoral election, Barr officials approached Walsh and his opponent, John Connolly, offering to fundacity arts-planning process. Former fellow Jesse Solomon is now executive director of BPE, which receives11percent of its budget from Barr."It is at the very center of the power structure,'' says education advocate and quest member Kevin Murray. 
So why shouldn't Barr fellows rise to prominent positions? That is, after all, the whole point of its fellowship program. But Barr is clearly building its political muscle as former fellows and former staffers take key positions at City Hall. It's certainly true that this is notanew story in the history of philanthropy--the Carnegies and the Rockefellers of the first Gilded Age didn't shy away from political influence--but the past few decades have seen an extraordinary rise in wealth. There are currently536billionaires in the country, and money equals power, whether it is coming from the Hostetters on the left or the Koch brothers on the right."It isatroubling phenomenon,'' says Callahan, of Inside Philanthropy."People fear the billionaires they disagree with and cheer the ones they agree with, as opposed to recognizing that all of them are pretty scary." 
Barr's influence is undeniable, from the hallowed corridors of City Hall to the scrappy and vital community organizations. The foundation has spent the past few years moving out of the world of anonymity and understands that transparency isagood thing. After all, Canales has spent much of his career promoting those beliefs. Yet this new approach also opens up the foundation to increased scrutiny. Public education advocates are watching, as are aspiring grantees and even potential trustees, who will be handpicked by Canales and the Hostetters. The city should also be keepingakeen eye. With its rich coffers, Barr wields the kind of power that can reshape Boston, from the air we breathe to the schools that educate our children to the public art we see on our streets. It will certainly be interesting to see who plays host the next time the NEA comes to town.

The new planning effort, he says, is an attempt to refocus the foundation's work and to increase its impact, not to start from scratch and createa"shiny new object," as Canales puts it. The strategy includes extending Barr's reach beyond Boston withamore regional focus in all three of its program areas, as well as subtle shifts, such asanew attention to success in and beyond high school, and changing the name of its Arts & Culture program to Arts & Creativity. 
Canales has made other changes, too. As of this year, Barr will no longer invest money in what are known as donor-advised funds--controversial because, by law, donors do not have to reveal how the money was spent. For tax reasons, Barr has taken advantage of one of these funds: Out ofatotal grant budget of $47 million in 2010, it deposited $9.5 million in the Fidelity Charitable Gift Fund. 
Private foundations are required by law to give away5percent of their assets annually--a requirement Barr meets in part thanks toacomplicated accounting system. This year's grant-making budget will increase to $70 million, up from $52 million in 2015. Critics such as David Callahan, founder and editor of Inside Philanthropy, point out Barr's enormous untapped potential, saying,"They are sitting onapile of money, with more waiting in the wings, but only deployingasmall fraction of it to solve huge problems like climate change.Iam waiting for them to swing for the fences." 
Asaresult, Barr is hardlyavanguard when it comes spending down its wealth. There isamovement in philanthropy called Giving While Living, founded by the duty-free-shopping titan Chuck Feeney, who gave the majority of his wealth to the New Yorkâ "based charity Atlantic Philanthropies. Feeney, along with Gates, Zuckerberg, and Bostonian Seth Klarman, are amongagroup of billionaires who signed what is known as the Giving Pledge,avow to donate the majority of their money to philanthropy. The Hostetters are not among that group. Meanwhile, the John Merck Fund, also based in Boston and withafocus on environmental issues, is spending down all of its assets by 2021. 
Canales says that the trustees have decided to stay the course for now but have left the door open for future generations of trustees to spend down. The trustees have also decided to expand the three-person board. Initially, new members will not include the Hostetter children."It is not the best time of life for Mom and Dad to be pulling on your strings,'' Barbara says."There will beaplace for the family on the board, but it will not beamajority." Inanod to Canales, she adds,"We want it run professionally. We want the benefit of the smartest people in the field." 
There are two types of foundations: those that hand out the money and simply trust it will be put to good use; and those that design programs, fund them, and micromanage them. Barr is somewhere in between. 
Particularly in the arts, Barr is what many in the field describe as an active funder. Actor and playwright Daniel Beaty receiveda$350,000 grant over three years to work with Emerson College, using theater to address social issues. He says that Barr is openly involved in the process and that he, for one, appreciates the input."Sometimes whenIapproach foundations,Ifeel likeIam trying to figure out how to makeapart of myself fit intoabox of what they fund,'' he says."My experience [with Barr] was thatIwas able to speak about the wholeness of whoIam." 
Barr's recent strategy aims to engage new audiences, explore technology, and branch out into other sectors, such as arts and medicine. It will also expand outside Boston. The recent program name change--from Arts & Culture to Arts & Creativity--broadens the scope to include nontraditional and emerging forms of expression. 
Barr designs some programs to"incentivize certain kinds of behavior," its Arts & Culture senior program director, San San Wong, says. Some relish Barr's hands-on approach, describing it as iterative, not directive. But others privately fear that Barr prods institutions to further its agenda. Canales, naturally, disagrees."We have no desire to force any organization to redefine its work to fit our objectives," he says. 
Jeff Poulos, executive director of Associated Grant Makers, applauds the new transparency that Canales has created at Barr, but hopes for more openness in the grant-making process."If the process is truly by invitation only, the responsibility of the program officers is to get to know the work of as broadaspectrum of grantees as possible,'' he says."Their responsibility is to look beyond the usual suspects and to havealook at the full ecology of the city, as opposed to bringing in preconceived notions." 
When choreographer Peter DiMuro became executive director of the Dance Complex, in Cambridge, in 2013, he knew he had to raise money, but wasn't optimistic."After the economy tanked in 2008,Isaw arts funding shrivel up, like the witch's shoes under the house in The Wizard of Oz," he says. But then he got The Call from Wong. Afterayear of conversations, Barr gave the Dance Complexawhopping $500,000 grant to be used for operating support and renovations--and DiMuro went from having visions of the Wicked Witch of the East to feeling he had reached the Emerald City. 
Barr has not shied away from funding groups that take their mission to the streets. The Better Future Project,ayouthful advocacy organization that has been around for only five years, gets12percent of its $500,000 annual budget from Barr."We are the most grassroots of the groups they support," says executive director Craig Altemose,"and they appreciate the on-the-ground work and the marching in the streets and the raisingaruckus when things are not headed in the right direction." 
When it comes to climate change, Barr works locally rather than globally, and it ranks second only to Minneapolis's McKnight Foundation in its regional efforts. It will continue to expand its works under Canales's new strategy and funnel money toward key priorities--namely, creating livable, walkable communities, improving public transportation, promoting clean energy, and advocating for public policy that supports those efforts. The climate-change program will focus more heavily on building smart communities with easily accessible transportation options. 
Of course, progressive, bike-riding Bostonians are nearly unanimous in their support for green transportation and community arts programs, but residents are deeply divided over issues that may haveasubstantial impact on our city. The issue of charter schools, for instance, opens the newly transparent Barr up to scrutiny and connects the foundation to the third rail of Boston politics: school choice. Over the years, the foundation's reach in education has been broad, with generous grants to support early childhood education, career training, and afterschool programming. Both Canales and director of education Leah Hamilton say that Barr's education funding is"agnostic" and not driven by an agenda other than to achieve better outcomes for all students. But Barr has been generous to several charters, making public education advocates fear that the foundation is on the same path as such charities as the Gates and the Walton foundations, which have poured huge amounts of money into charter schools and are pushingadrive for public policy to support them. 
Members of the Citywide Parent Council and Quality Education for Every Student (QUEST)--two groups staunchly opposed to charters--are wary of Barr and its grant-making. They are highly critical of the Boston Compact,acoalition of charter, district, and parochial schools that is funded by Gates. Barr has paid out $150,000 to Boston Public Schools and Wheelock College to help establish the Compact here. The Compact is the driving force behind Boston's"unified enrollment" plan, which will change the way students are assigned to schools. Barr is also investing $5 million in the Fort Pointâ "based Boston Plan for Excellence (BPE), which runsanationally recognized teacher-training program as well asacharter school. These connections--combined with Barr's enormous wealth, influence, and political clout--raise fear and suspicion among parents and advocates who adamantly support public education over privatization."A small group withagreat deal of power and influence is shapingaplan with little input," says Mary Battenfeld,amember of QUEST and the Citywide Parent Council, and it"will radically restructure and possibly destroy Boston Public Schools." 
Canales, whose foundation helped bankroll the search for superintendent Chang, says he was not aware of the growing controversy, which has been getting louder and more heated as the debate over unified enrollment unfolds. He stands by the foundation's funding record, which includesadiverse portfolio in education grants, and he--like the advocates--is aware that funders must be very careful when investing in projects that affect people's lives. But advocates are concerned."The gap between the funders and these children is so wide,'' Battenfeld says."You have these funders who have so much money and live in suchadifferent world than the majority of those families. They are trying to determine policy for kids who they know nothing about." 
Breeze through the résumés of officials at City Hall, and you will find clear evidence of Barr. The city's first chief of education isaformer Barr director, and the chief of economic development isaformer Barr fellow. Canales talks regularly with city officials, says Joyce Linehan, Mayor Walsh's chief of policy, and Canales describes the foundation asa"constructive partner" with city government. During the2013mayoral election, Barr officials approached Walsh and his opponent, John Connolly, offering to fundacity arts-planning process. Former fellow Jesse Solomon is now executive director of BPE, which receives11percent of its budget from Barr."It is at the very center of the power structure,'' says education advocate and quest member Kevin Murray. 
So why shouldn't Barr fellows rise to prominent positions? That is, after all, the whole point of its fellowship program. But Barr is clearly building its political muscle as former fellows and former staffers take key positions at City Hall. It's certainly true that this is notanew story in the history of philanthropy--the Carnegies and the Rockefellers of the first Gilded Age didn't shy away from political influence--but the past few decades have seen an extraordinary rise in wealth. There are currently536billionaires in the country, and money equals power, whether it is coming from the Hostetters on the left or the Koch brothers on the right."It isatroubling phenomenon,'' says Callahan, of Inside Philanthropy."People fear the billionaires they disagree with and cheer the ones they agree with, as opposed to recognizing that all of them are pretty scary." 
Barr's influence is undeniable, from the hallowed corridors of City Hall to the scrappy and vital community organizations. The foundation has spent the past few years moving out of the world of anonymity and understands that transparency isagood thing. After all, Canales has spent much of his career promoting those beliefs. Yet this new approach also opens up the foundation to increased scrutiny. Public education advocates are watching, as are aspiring grantees and even potential trustees, who will be handpicked by Canales and the Hostetters. The city should also be keepingakeen eye. With its rich coffers, Barr wields the kind of power that can reshape Boston, from the air we breathe to the schools that educate our children to the public art we see on our streets. It will certainly be interesting to see who plays host the next time the NEA comes to town.

Who's Behind the Barr Foundation
The organization seems to be everywhere â " driving Boston's agenda on climate change, the arts, and charter schools.
By Patti Hartigan
A lot can be learned when the NEA comes to town. 
In 1991--in the midst of the culture wars--U.S. Representative Chester Atkins ferried the National Endowment for the Arts director onatour designed to highlight the agency's good deeds around Boston.Afew years later, Senator Edward Kennedy did the same, accompanying the NEA chairwoman to an elementary school in Roxbury, where they sat on teeny chairs and watched adorable tots performaconcert. These official visits were as carefully choreographed asaSwan Lake solo, and featured our biggest-name elected officials in their snazziest suits. So something was decidedly different last May when NEA chairwoman Jane Chu arrived onawhistle-stop tour and the host was the wholly unelected Jim Canales, president of the Barr Foundation--the state's wealthiest and most influential privately funded philanthropy. Unlike previous visits, this time around the sights and speakers on the tour hadasingular theme: They all received generous funding from Barr. Sure, folks from City Hall and the state arts council were on hand, but the picture was clear: Barr is in control. 
Although the Barr Foundation has given out more than $710 million since 1999, chances are you've never heard of it. Until around 2010, donations were largely made on the condition of anonymity. Now that grants are given openly, Barr's influence is finally visible. Established29years ago by Amos and Barbara Hostetter, who founded Continental Cablevision, it started asakitchen-table family operation: Amos handled the investments, and Barbara managed the programs. In 2016, the foundation has assets totaling $1.6 billion andamandate to focus its philanthropic endeavors on Boston and the region. 
Now, suddenly, you can't turn around without coming across an organization or project bearing the Barr Foundation's stamp of approval. Barr is, after all--along with the Klarman Family Foundation--the funding muscle behind Boston Creates, the city's yearlong process to developacultural master plan. But the Barr Foundation's generous funding is not limited to the arts. It is equally indispensable in two other important arenas: education and climate change. Recently, for instance, it granted $5 million to Year Up,anonprofit that links young urban adults with educational and career opportunities. In climate change, Barr funds research studies as well as grassroots organizations such as the Massachusetts branch of the Clean Water Fund. You've rentedaHubway bike? Barr isapartner in that venture as well. 
Barr's influence, however, extends well beyond bikes on the streets all the way to City Hall and the State House. Barr Foundation money helped fund the search for Boston's new school superintendent, Tommy Chang, and several Barr fellows were on Mayor Marty Walsh's transition team. John Barros,aformer Barr fellow, is Walsh's chief of economic development, and Rahn Dorsey, Barr's former evaluation director, is the city's first chief of education. Barr also funds Go Boston 2030, the Walsh administration's initiative to redefine transportation in the city, and two Barr fellows withdrew from the program last year to join Governor Charlie Baker's administration. 
You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't credit the Barr for its enormous largesse, as the left-leaning charity funds causes that are dear to the city's liberal residents. But you would also be hard-pressed to findagrantee who will critique the foundation publicly. No big surprise there. Barr makes its grants by invitation only. Those who receive funding want to keep it, and those who don't want to get it. Like all foundations,"They tend to live inabubble of positivity,'' says Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy."They are surrounded by people who are predisposed to tell them whatever they want to hear." 
In private, though, many City Hall watchdogs, including some grantees, are questioning the kind of clout that Barr wields in public policy and city government."Private foundations--whether it be the Hostetter family or Bill and Melinda Gates or the Walton family from Walmart--can operate with impunity in perpetuity and can have enormous impact on public policy issues," says Alan Cantor,anonprofit consultant based in New Hampshire."With our elected leaders, we can unelect them, but we cannot get rid of the private philanthropists." 
If you enjoy your Hubway, your fine-arts organizations, and efforts to create universal early childhood education, you can thank cable television. Amos Hostetter,aself-made pioneer in the industry, sold his Continental Cablevision to U.S. West in1996for $10.8 billion. Today, he and his wife are worth some $3 billion, according to Forbes. The couple knew they wanted to use their new wealth to"do good," but unlike such current tech magnates as Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, who broadcast their philanthropic efforts, the Hostetters choseaquieter route, starting what at first was called the Hostetter Foundation in 1987. Twelve years later, they changed the name of the foundation to Barr, after Amos Hostetter's middle name,asubtle way of keeping the family connection without grandstanding. 
The Hostetters are notoriously private. They live inamansion on Beacon Hill, butaclose associate says they didn't raise their three children--Caroline, Elizabeth, and Tripp--with silver spoons in their mouths. Caroline isanowaprincipal at the consulting firm the Parthenon Group; Elizabeth is pursuing an MBA at Harvard; and Tripp attended Duke University. They all share an interest in the foundation, but Barbara Hostetter says she wants them to build their own lives and careers. 
As newcomers to philanthropy, Amos and Barbara Hostetter didn't harbor delusions of grandeur, let alone pretend to know what they were doing."It's important to know when you start this work that there is no expertise in the house," Barbara says."We didn't start with being the smartest people in the room. We knew we hadagood learning curve ahead of us." 
But there was another reason they didn't pretend to know what they were doing."Humility," Barbara says softly, sitting inaconference room at the Pilot House, the waterfront property on Atlantic Avenue that is home to the Barr Foundation headquarters. The room affordsastunning view of the harbor, and the offices are well appointed without being ostentatious, with gleaming natural-wood floors, exposed beams, and brick walls. Barbara doesn't play the stock role ofapowerful magnate capable of changing the lives of those less fortunate. On the contrary, she is modest and contemplative, not so much guarded as reserved. As the last person to arrive for our interview in the conference room, she reluctantly sits at the head of the table, but it's clear she'd rather not be the center of attention. 
As they slowly built their foundation, the Hostetters hired staff members who knew how to direct funds to their targeted areas of interest. But the grant-giving remained largely anonymous, with the stipulation that grantees couldn't mention the foundation in marketing materials. In 2010, though, the Barr and its carefully guarded profile began to shift when the foundation boldly announced that it was directing $50 million over five years to fight climate change."It was an opportunity to use our voice," Barbara says. 
It was alsoaway of flexing some muscle to advance the couple's green agenda. But it's not just about money: It's about political clout and using power to forge public policy. Amos Hostetter is now cochair, along with Mayor Walsh, of Boston's Green Ribbon Commission,agroup of power players who advise the city on its Climate Action Plan."A foundation like Barr has two roles," says Robert Lynch, president and CEO of the advocacy group Americans for the Arts."The first is obviously giving out money. The second isapublic role, standing up there asaleader saying these are changes we believe in." 
Barbara gets it."We began to realize that we don't have the privilege of stepping back and doing the work anonymously," she says."We need to stand behind the work to leverage it and make it better." To do this, the Hostetters knew they needed the best and the brightest. Enter the foundation's new executive: Jim Canales. 
Canales's star had already risen by the time the Hostetters began recruiting him to be Barr's first president--and its third trustee, joining Amos and Barbara on the board--in 2014. As president and CEO of the James Irvine Foundation in San Francisco, he was at the helm ofa$2 billion philanthropic organization in sunny California, his lifelong home. The couple courted Canales, but he needed to be persuaded."His values are akin to our own," Barbara says, explaining why she and her husband pursued Canales."He believes in humility and collaboration and partnerships in philanthropy." 
After discussing the position with the Hostetters over lunch, it took two weeks for the Stanford University alum, who sits on the school's board of trustees, to accept the job. Ultimately enticed by the idea of not only leadingafoundation with deep pockets and community roots, but of reshaping it and refining its strategy, he says,"It wasasingular leadership opportunity." 
Canales embraces the Hostetters' commitment to humility, but carries himself withaforward-looking panache that the couple would be uncomfortable employing themselves. He knows how to workacrowd in both English and Spanish, and grew up in San Francisco withamother whose family is from Nicaragua andafather whose family is from Mexico. After graduating from Stanford withaBA in English and an MA in education by 1989, he worked asahigh school English teacher before entering philanthropy. Maybe that's where he developed his communication savvy. He joined the Irvine Foundation in 1993, rising to president10years later. After accepting the job at Barr, he moved to Boston with his husband, James McCann,adoctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. They live inacondo at Millennium Place, the Washington Street property that defines itself as"a new form of luxury urbanism." His total compensation last year wasashade over $700,000. 
As an outsider inatown not known for its fondness of strangers, Canales has quickly immersed himself in Boston's field of movers and shakers. He is cochair of the Boston Creates Leadership Council,agroup of roughly60arts leaders, donors, and civic leaders.Iwatched him dazzle them at one of the council's recent meetings, and he had no trouble coming up with anyone's name."The fact thatIamanewcomer here cuts both ways," he told me during an interview at the Barr offices."I havealot to learn, and the learning curve has been steep. On the other hand, you look at things withafresh perspective. You're not as anchored in the past." 
Driven by Canales's charisma and professionalism, Barr has burst onto the scene recently asapublic force. Canales hasareputation for his commitment to transparency in philanthropy, and he swiftly took steps to make the once-secretive foundation more public. He oversaw Barr's new website, withagrants database, staff blogs, and links to the foundation's tax returns, and establishedalively presence on social media."Foundations are increasingly realizing that they bring more to the table than resources," Canales says."One thing they bring is their voice. None of this is about self-aggrandizement. This is in service to the goals that we are trying to achieve." 
As part of his reboot, Canales rewrote the foundation's mission statement, which now defines the charity as"stewards and catalysts," and was charged with forginganew strategic planning effort that he is rolling out this winter."Evolution not revolution" is his mantra. The new planning effort, he says, is an attempt to refocus the foundation's work and to increase its impact, not to start from scratch and createa"shiny new object," as Canales puts it. The strategy includes extending Barr's reach beyond Boston withamore regional focus in all three of its program areas, as well as subtle shifts, such asanew attention to success in and beyond high school, and changing the name of its Arts & Culture program to Arts & Creativity.

Clean, green wind power might be our best weapon against climate change. So why do some people say it's their worst nightmare?
By Amy Crawford
It'sagray, rainy August morning in the South Shore town of Kingston, and I'm standing inagravel pit, looking up atawindmill that, at some400feet to the tip of its blades, is more than half the height of the Prudential Tower. I'd seen the giant turbine, and three other large ones, from several miles out asIapproached from Route 3, but only now, standing right under it, canIappreciate the sheer size. As gusts of wind rustle the long grass at my feet, the turbine whirs steadily, the rotation of its 144-foot fiberglass blades, each weighing6tons, accompanied byafaint whoosh and whistle.Alow electric hum emanates from the nacelle,aschool-bus-size structure behind the blades that housesagenerator capable of producing up to2megawatts of clean electricity. Operating at35percent capacity, as is typical for onshore windmills, that's enough to power as many as700homes while producing 2,300 fewer tons of carbon dioxide each year than would conventional power sources.
The turbine, and the two others nearby, belong to No Fossil Fuel,asmall company founded byalocal businesswoman, who has converted some of the land below them into an organic farm. They cost about $2.5 million apiece and have together generated nearly $2.3 million in revenue since they went up at the end of 2011. Kingston, withapopulation of about 12,000, is also home toa400-foot turbine that the town authorizedaprivate developer to plant onacapped landfill in exchange for rent payments andadeal on electricity. Then there's the comparatively miniature windmill--just120feet tall--that the MBTA operates next to Kingston's commuter-rail station.
The turbines in Kingston are part ofafast-developing effort to build up wind power in Massachusetts. Last year there were43onshore wind projects in the state supplying enough energy for about 32,000 homes, and more than half of that capacity had come online since 2012. Another five times that capacity was in the planning or permitting stages last year. Governor Deval Patrick has setagoal of wind supplying Massachusetts with10percent of its electricity--enough to power 800,000 homes--by 2020. That would mean as many as 1,000 turbines on land and offshore. And that hasalot of people concerned, because even though polling shows that most Massachusetts residents support the turbine effort, windmills, as I've begun to learn during my time in Kingston, producealot more than just clean energy.
To the east of the gravel pit where I'm standing is Route 3, known along this stretch as the Pilgrims Highway, and on the far side of the busy roadway isacul-de-sac of modest gambrel and split-level houses built around 1980. In one of these lives the Reilly family--Doreen, her husband, Sean, and their three teenage children. The turbine on the landfill is960feet from their back door.
"It makes you sick--you have to leave your home," says Doreen as we sit around the Reillys' kitchen table after work one evening.A49-year-old hospital registrar who usually worksaswing shift, she tears up from time to time as she talks about the turbine. 
Sean,afit 49-year-old withablond buzz cut, describes how for several weeks each year the setting sun behind the turbine casts the house inamoving shadow."The flicker illuminates the whole room," he says."It takes over the whole house." 
"And the noise fromaturbine is something else entirely," Doreen says. 
"It's justapulsating noise that goes to different pitches," Sean explains."It gets in your house--there'sapressure to it. There've been nights when it's woken me up every hour, on the hour." 
Sean would like to move away, and the couple has madeahalfhearted effort to sell their home of20years. But Doreen andahandful of other Kingston residents have also taken upabattle to get the town's windmills turned off. They've amassed reams of documents, attended meetings of various town boards, and spoken against the turbines to neighbors and local media."I have put in maybe200hours at least on this turbine," Doreen says."I've read more about turbines thanIever wanted to know." 
For help, Doreen and her neighbors also did what scores of homeowners across Massachusetts have done when faced withawindmill in their backyard: They looked to the grassroots organization that has emerged as the face of the state's anti-turbine movement, Wind Wise Massachusetts. Relying on volunteers and individual donations, the group has worked to defeat wind projects from Nantucket to Lenox. (Its list of"dead" projects now numbers 48, most of which were killed by opposition from nearby homeowners.) Wind Wise and its allies believe wind turbines are noisy and ugly, and that their ability to reduce greenhouse gases has been vastly overstated. The group also believes windmills are responsible for wind turbine syndrome,acontroversial diagnosis involving dizziness, nausea, headaches, ear pain, and an array of other frightening symptoms in people who live too close to large turbines. 
In addition to the turbines Wind Wise has managed to scuttle, it has been able, so far at least, to blockaproposed state law that would relax regulations and make it easier to build new windmills."We have no money, really," says Virginia Irvine,aBrimfield resident and the president of Wind Wise."We try to bring information to people, and it's really difficult when you areagrassroots organization." The cause is helped by the fact that Wind Wise now has volunteers in200towns and about20affiliated local groups. It also maintains an active Web presence, mobilizes speakers to testify on Beacon Hill, and employs an energetic PR man. 
Wind Wise, as you might imagine, is not without its critics. Professor James Manwell,amechanical engineer and director of the Wind Energy Center at UMass Amherst, says Massachusetts is windy enough to eventually generate all of the energy it needs from turbines, but he worries that the growing backlash from groups like Wind Wise could set that goal back indefinitely."I consider the opponentsareal hindrance," Manwell says. People who live near turbines have some legitimate concerns, he adds, but"it's hard to separate fact from hysteria." 
Environmentalists and state officials who believe that wind isacrucial weapon against climate change have been squaring off against Wind Wise and its allies in towns like Kingston all across the state, and the battles have created strange bedfellows. People who might otherwise support clean energy suddenly find themselves joining forces with climate-change skeptics inafight to keep giant turbines out of their communities. Looming above the struggle are important questions about how the state regulates wind, and about the role of the fossil-fuel industry in an ostensibly grassroots movement. 
On the ground, however, the concerns are more immediate."We don't hate wind turbines," Sean Reilly says."We just want our quality of life back." 
In Kingston, the fight to have the windmills taken offline has ignitedabattle that's turned neighbor against neighbor. Those who support the turbines say Wind Wise volunteers are interlopers spreading misinformation. Arguments over turbine noise and the alleged health impacts have erupted on Facebook and spilled over into town meetings. Meanwhile,agroup of10homeowners has sued the town's zoning board of appeals and No Fossil Fuel, the owner of three of the windmills in town, alleging that the building permits for the project were illegal. While officials express sympathy for families like the Reillys, some say all the discord threatens to drown out legitimate concerns about noise and shadow flicker."There are divisions in town that weren't there before," says Elaine Fiore, the chair of Kingston's board of selectmen. 
Though the turbines face fierce opposition in some corners of Kingston, overall they remain quite popular.Asurvey by Tufts University in2012found that78percent of residents approved of them, and just26percent said the sound was disturbing. Beyond the allure of generating clean energy, people in town also like the financial benefits provided by the windmills. The turbine on the landfill produces $124,630 in annual lease and tax payments for the town,afigure that will rise during the 20-year lease, plus some $70,000ayear in energy savings. The privately owned turbines, meanwhile, bring Kingston as much as $200,000ayear in property taxes and about $1,000amonth in energy savings. And in part because it eased the permitting process for alternative-energy projects, Kingston is now designated asaMassachusetts Green Community, resulting in more than $450,000 in state grants so far. Kingston town planner Tom Bott says the town has used the grants to upgrade its fire station, elementary school, and library. 
Supporters of the town's turbines cast Wind Wise asapack of reactionaries thwarting the promise of green energy."We all realize that global warming is notajoke," says Mark Beaton, who spent the better part ofadecade trying to bring wind to Kingston, and who is chair of the town's Green Energy Committee. Beaton andIare having lunch at the bar and grill he owns in town, the Charlie Horse. He's installed solar panels on the restaurant's roof, and he runs his truck on biodiesel made from the kitchen's leftover grease. His face turns red when he talks about Wind Wise, which he says is holding back progress on climate change--and playing into the hands of the fossil-fuel industry."Kingston is justalittle microcosm of what's going on," he says."It's not really grassroots that creates this kind of misinformation, and it's certainly not in the interest of the fossil-fuel people to have clean energy." 
Indeed, some conservative activists with ties to the fossil-fuel industry have recognized the benefits of allying themselves with groups like Wind Wise. In 2010,aself-described"backwoods scientist" and prominent climate-change skeptic from North Carolina named John Droz Jr. spoke atalecture series in West Barnstable organized by Wind Wise's Cape Cod affiliate. He also gaveatalk in Falmouth in2012at the invitation of Wind Wise volunteers there. Droz, as it happened, was thenasenior fellow at the American Tradition Institute (now called the Energy & Environment Legal Institute),athink tank funded in part by the oil billionaires Charles and David Koch, where he argued tirelessly that turbines are inefficient andawaste of money. In February 2012, Droz hostedagroup of"wind warriors" atatwo-day meeting in Washington to plananational public relations campaign against wind energy. In attendance were officials from right-wing groups with such upbeat names as"the Committee foraConstructive Tomorrow" and"the Competitive Enterprise Institute," along with representatives from20to30state and local groups, including Wind Wise Massachusetts and the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound,agroup organized to oppose the Cape Wind project. The goal of the meeting, according toamemo later leaked to the U.K. newspaper The Guardian, was to"createagrass-roots ground swell from which the clamor for change will reach the elected officials and policy-makers." The memo stressed the importance of"inputs from local groups and others who have an interest in spreading the message." 
Wind Wise leaders are adamant that the group has no ties to fossil fuel, but it has been successful at getting the anti-wind message out. Mark Beaton recallsapanel discussion the group held at the Kingston Intermediate School shortly after the town's turbines were turned on in the spring of 2012. The panelists, most of them representatives of Wind Wise, raisedanumber of concerns about windmills, among them that they lower nearby property values (in truth, the few surveys that exist have shown little actual effect); that they loom over landscapes, dwarfing human-scale buildings; and that they produce sounds and shadows that drive some neighbors, like the Reillys, to distraction. But what really moved the crowd in attendance, Beaton tells me, were the frightening stories about wind turbine syndrome."They scared the living bejesus out of the residents of Kingston," he says. 
Wind turbine syndrome has recently begun to receive more and more attention. Its vaguely defined but disturbing constellation of physical symptoms range from anxiety and migraines to heart palpitations and high blood pressure. The symptoms are said to be attributable to low-frequency sound."We think of noise as just being felt with the ears," explains Lilli-Ann Green,ahealthcare consultant and former art teacher who sits on the Wind Wise board and is the group's top adviser on the science behind wind turbine syndrome."But sound is pressure waves--it's hitting your body over and over again. Many people have ear pressure and ear pain and headaches.Alot of people have nausea and dizziness, the same symptoms you would see if you were seasick." Green's concern over the syndrome helped motivate her to formalocal group that -defeatedaproposed turbine near her home in Wellfleet in 2010. After that, she and her husband began spreading the message in towns like Kingston and Falmouth, as well as in other communities where public opposition wound up sinking wind proposals. 
For his part, Mark Beaton believes that wind turbine syndrome is so much hooey."They come in, get people riled up, give them misinformation," he says."We have countered all their claims at public meetings, said, 'This is not happening.'" 
Still, in community after community where windmill projects are being considered, the specter of wind turbine syndrome has roused opposition."Typically what happens is people hear thatawind power plant is going to be built in their town, and they get online and start doing -research," says Eleanor Tillinghast, who lives in the Berkshires and helped found Wind Wise Massachusetts in 2010."And then they reach out to us." 
Onablustery day in September,Itravel to Falmouth to visit Sue Hobart,awoman who has received her share of coverage in the local press because she believes she is suffering froma-serious case of wind turbine syndrome. Though Hobart has no official affiliation with Wind Wise, the group's publicist, Barry Wanger, has urged me to meet with her soIcan see for myself the effects of living nearawindmill. 
Hobart has asked me to meet her at her abandoned home,acustom-built ranch at the end ofalong gravel driveway, surrounded by scrub oak and wilting hydrangeas. WhenIarrive, she and her husband, Ed, take me onatour of the house, which has been sitting empty since 2012, when they fled toafixer-upper in Bourne. On the back deck, we pause to peer through the trees ata400-foot turbine that sits next toasand pit about 1,600 feet away. WhenIcan hear it, the turbine sounds likeafar-off jet plane. 
"You hear that thing that's likearoar?" Ed asks. 
"Nobody thinks it's going to hurt them,alittle sound like that," Sue says."You think you can get used to it, but it gets worse and worse." We listen to the turbine for another minute or two, and then Sue suggests we retreat to the front porch, where we won't get"whomped." 
Sue, who is 58, says she first began feeling symptoms of wind turbine syndrome shortly after the town's third windmill went up, in the summer of 2011. It started withalittle dizziness andapersistent headache, which she attributed to the busy season at her job asawedding florist, and to the stress of having Ed,aresearch engineer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, away at sea. She felt nauseous and tired, and she couldn't sleep. In time, she came to realize that she felt better when she was away from the house, and slowly it dawned on her that the turbine was making her ill. She began to research wind turbines online, eventually coming across the work of Nina Pierpont,apediatrician in upstate New York. 
The idea that windmills can make you sick was popularized by Pierpont in her book, Wind Turbine Syndrome, which she self-published in 2009. After windmill developers came to her town in2004seeking land leases, Pierpont conducted phone interviews with10families in North America and Europe who reported disturbed sleep, ear problems, headaches, irritability, and loss of cognitive function after wind turbines were built nearby. She concluded that infrasound--noise at frequencies below the level of human hearing--could be interfering with the balance organs of the inner ear and causing people's internal organs to vibrate. The book's methodology and conclusions remain highly controversial. Pierpont declined to be interviewed for this article. 
Steven Rauch, an ear, nose, and throat specialist at Harvard Medical School who examined Sue Hobart, says Pierpont's hypothesis is plausible, although until further research is done, he considers himself"agnostic.""There is no direct evidence yet to support this diagnosis," Rauch says,"but there'salot of circumstantial evidence that says it's probably real." The inner ear's sensitivity to infrasound has been documented previously, he explains, and"it deserves to be studied." 
A few surveys by doctors and psychologists in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand, and Europe have similarly found that some people who live near wind turbines report symptoms consistent with the syndrome, but so far no rigorous research has directly supported Pierpont's claims. In 2012aliterature review commissioned by the Massachusetts departments of Environmental Protection and Public Health found no evidence that the syndrome exists--though that conclusion has been vigorously disputed by Wind Wise. And last yearateam of researchers at the University of Sydney, in Australia, concluded the syndrome isa"communicated disease," likely to be caused by the nocebo effect.Iasked the study's lead author, the public health professor Simon Chapman, what that means, exactly."The nocebo effect," he told me,"is the ugly stepsister of the placebo effect." People can experience real, physical symptoms simply because they expect an otherwise harmless substance or stimulus to hurt them, Chapman explained."The old expression 'to worry yourself sick' is very relevant here." 
Chapman and his colleagues searched records to compileahistory of complaints against wind farms in Australia, and found that nearly two-thirds had never received complaints about health or noise from people who lived nearby. The majority of complaints, he says, came from people who lived near six wind farms that had been targeted by opposition groups, and79percent occurred after 2009, when Pierpont's book was published and groups opposing wind power began spreading the word. 
Chapman's conclusion was bolstered byarecent New Zealand study from the University of Auckland, which showed that people who are told that infrasound can make them ill later report feeling unpleasant symptoms when told they're being exposed to infrasound in the lab--even when they are not. People who weren't told to expect adverse effects were far less likely to report problems, even when exposed to actual infrasound. 
Still, Chapman acknowledges, telling people it's all in their head will not make wind turbine syndrome go away."When an individual says to you, 'I am really sick,' and they look emotional, they look drawn, and they have people around them corroborating this," he says,"it really takesalot of interpersonal courage to say, 'Here is some counterfactual information.'" 
Whatever Chapman's research may have found, Sue Hobart is certain that she's suffering from wind turbine syndrome. The suggestion that her symptoms could be caused by anything else gets her shaking with anger."I got to the point of near suicide, andIwas hospitalized," she tells me at her house. Eventually she moved into the cellar to get as far from the noise as possible."I was sleeping in the basement with mice running around the insulation above my head, getting crazier and crazier. It was the worst time in my life." At the invitation of Wind Wise members, she and Ed have spoken to groups in towns that are considering hosting wind turbines."This will be exposed," she avows."It's like secondhand smoke, and asbestos, and everything else. The green-energy team is suppressing it." 
Indeed, things in Falmouth have lately begun to go the Hobarts' way. In November, responding toalawsuit filed by neighbors,ajudge ordered the town to turn off the two 400-foot-tall turbines at its water-treatment plant from7p.m. to7a.m. Monday through Saturday, and all day Sunday, along with Thanksgiving Day, Christmas, and New Year's. And in December, the town's zoning board of appeals declared the turbinesanuisance in response to complaints from Vietnam veteran Barry Funfar, who said they were causing him"mental confusion and anxiety." Funfar's case had been championed online by Wind Wise and Nina Pierpont. 
Unlike Wind Turbine syndrome, the science behind climate change is well established, and the need for sources of energy that do not contribute to it is something most Americans agree on--a recent Gallup poll showed71percent support more wind power. Right now, wind supplies4percent of U.S. energy needs, and the Department of Energy says it could generateafifth of our power by 2030. But while most people want more windmills, it seems that few want windmills in their backyard. As people like the Hobarts and the Reillys demonstrate, more thought may need to go into how America develops its wind power network. 
Despite state leaders' enthusiasm for wind, Massachusetts has so far left the details in the hands of cities and towns, offering tempting incentives to build turbines with little guidance about where they should go. The state does haveamodel bylaw that, if municipalities choose to adopt it, requires that turbines be set back from the nearest home byadistance of at least three times the height of the turbine--usually about 1,200 feet--but that limit has not been widely implemented. The legislature has before it the proposed Wind Energy Siting Reform Act, which would require the state to form an advisory group that would set statewide standards for noise and flicker. However, because the act would also expedite the approval process for turbines and limit appeals from opponents, it has attracted strong opposition from groups like Wind Wise and has so far failed to reach Governor Patrick's desk. 
In the absence of guidelines, fights like the one in Kingston threaten to erupt across the state. But if attempts at regulation seem paralyzed right now, anti-wind activists are heartened by the rulings in Falmouth, which was one of the first towns to erect large wind turbines near homes, and which now is one of the first to take steps toward shutting them down."It does give me hope that the tide's starting to turn against these things being in residential areas," Sean Reilly says."We do need alternative energy, but you can't put it near people who are trying to live in their homes." 
In Kingston, the state is conducting an acoustic study of the landfill turbine, and the town is consideringabylaw that would require the turbines to be shut down when shadow flicker is at its worst--a compromise the Reillys say would goalong way toward alleviating their distress. But what is good news to the anti-wind forces in town has only frustrated those who support the turbines. Back at his bar and grill, Mark Beaton says he'd hoped that Kingston's embrace of alternative energy would serve asamodel for other Massachusetts towns. Instead, he now worries that clean energy has lost the public relations battle."Wind Wise comes in, you've got the politicians that are afraid of losing the vote, and the whole thing is threatening to come toascreeching halt because ofavocal minority," he says."Kingston isatest case. If they start curtailing it, no bank, no insurance company, no bonding company is going to go into Massachusetts and put upaturbine."

 Harvard, Ye Hypocrites 
 On the global issue that matters most, Harvard University is losing credibility--not to mention money.
By Bill McKibben
Many people remember college only throughaslightly golden haze: the big game, the all-nighter, the favorite professor. It's not malice, this refusal to examine the alma mater too closely--it's just emotionally convenient, especially if you went toaplace like Harvard. For all of its glories--the fascinating fellow students, the wonderful classes--it's hard not to feel uncomfortable with all of what Harvard means. Here's why: The plural of"privilege" is"establishment," and if you graduated from Harvard you're part of one, like it or not. The immediate question is,"How healthy is that establishment?" The answer,Ithink, is not very.
This occurred to me this past April asIspent part of the week stretched out inasleeping bag amid the shrubbery in front of Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust's office. Hundreds of us--students and faculty, but lots and lots of alumni--were there at some point during Harvard Heat Week to protest the university's refusal to divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies, even as those companies continue to drive us closer to the edge of catastrophic climate change. We weren't asking for anything particularly radical: Institutions ranging from Stanford to Hampshire College, and from the United Church of Christ to the Unitarians, had already started down the divestment path. And in the months since our Harvard protest, they've been joined by everyone from the Episcopal Church to the largest insurance company in France to Norway's government pension fund, a.k.a. the largest sovereign wealth fund on Earth.
But Harvard was different. Despiteastrong organizing effort by students, who in2012convinced nearly three-quarters of their peers to back divestment, the university had issuedaquick initial rejection and refused to budge after faculty members petitioned in 2014. Yes, it was very concerned about climate change. No, it would not divest. In fact, it had offered the back of its hand. In the small corner of its portfolio that is visible to the public, Harvard had (around the time that more than 300,000 people marched in New York for climate action and as the World Council of Churches announced plans to divest) increased its investments in fossil fuel companies byafactor of seven.
Its biggest new investment was inacompany, Anadarko Petroleum, that illustrated every reason thousands of alumni were joining students and faculty in the divestment demand. Not only had the company paid the largest settlement in the history of American environmental contamination cases, but it was alsoabig funder of the political campaigns launched by prominent climate deniers. Above all, though, its basic business plan showed what it thought about global warming: Even though scientists have conclusively demonstrated that no more thanathird of the coal, oil, and gas reserves can be burned if we wish to keep climate change under control, Anadarko boasted to its investors that it expected to"drill nine to12deepwater exploration/appraisal wells focusing on play- opening exploration opportunities in Colombia, Kenya, and the Gulf of Mexico." That is to say, inaworld where by any measure we already have too much carbon, it wanted to find some more. And that's the business plan Harvard was buying into.
When challenged about it, Harvard maintainedanearly perfect unruffled calm. If students surrounded the president's office, the president moved her operations to another building. When demonstrators stagedasit-in at the alumni office, alumni officials gave us baseball caps.
This kind of calm--after2014setarecord for the hottest year ever measured on Earth,arecord that2015is now obliterating-- interested me. It angered me, too,Iconfess, but above all it interested me. What were they thinking? 
Faust--a superb scholar,afine writer, and by all accountsagood president (not to mentionawoman who, in her youth, left school to march in Selma, Alabama)--laid out the university's reasoning in 2013. Some of her points were sensible: Harvard's main job is to research and teach, and in those realms it is doingaremarkable job, for an ever-broader swath of students. But her direct response to divestment was risible. Since the university relies on fossil fuels to power its buildings, transportation, computers, and appliances, she said, there wasa"troubling inconsistency in the notion" of divestment--arguing that, in effect, Harvard could act on the problem only once it had been solved. And her belief that Harvard would instead address climate change in"more effective ways" was unpersuasive. It's sweet that the university"has created awards to recognize 'heroes' who are helping to make Harvard green," but compared with dissolving ice caps, it seems somehow insubstantial. And unconvincing: By this point even the former chairman of Shell has called divestmenta"rational" response to the"distressing" lack of climate action by the big fossil fuel companies.
No, there was something deeper here. Harvard is many things, all of them arguable but one: It's the richest university in the world, what some have calledahedge fund withauniversity attached. That's too cynical, but there's something about Harvard's relationship with money that gets in the way of clear thinking.
Among the highest-paid people at the university, for instance, are its fund managers. In 2013, one of them made $11.5 million, which is $6.1 million more than the University of Alabama shelled out for Nick Saban, the highest-paid college football coach in the country. If you ever groused about the fact that football coaches make more money than professors--well, this one fund manager is paid more than57professors. And that's actually an improvement: Harvard has reined in its compensation fromadecade ago, when some managers were making upward of $30 million.
It's not as if they're irreplaceable financial geniuses, either. To demandasalary like Saban's, most years you'd need to contend for the national championship, or at least the Cotton Bowl. But Harvard's returns are middling at best. Up against the20comparable (though smaller) endowments in 2012, it came in 18th; over the past five years, 19th; over the past decade, 13th. Those aren't Crimson Tide numbers; those are Vanderbilt numbers. Oh, and over the past five years Harvard's returns have trailed, um, index funds. In fact, here's what's really interesting: Investors who have divested from fossil fuel companies have outperformed the broader market for the past five years. If Harvard's managers had paid attention to the students demanding divestment, they'd likely have made the university more money.
But it's less about the return than the ethos. Earlier this year, for instance, Harvard got its biggest gift ever, $400 million to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, from hedge fund manager John Paulson. InaHuffington Post op-ed, economist Jeffrey Sachs argues that Paulson essentially swindled the money from small-scale German investors by convincing Goldman Sachs to set upadesigned-to-fail fund he could then bet against. (Paulson was never charged withacrime.) The dean of Harvard Business School called Paulson the"epitome ofavisionary leader," which inacertain sense is true,Iguess, but not perhaps in the sense he meant.
After decades of sendingalarge number of its graduates to Wall Street, Harvard has actually been good in recent years about expanding the establishment to include people who don't look like the inbred scions who once dominated it. But the university's domination by Wall Street seems to have eroded the few valuable things an establishment offers--above all the idea that inatime of crisis it would rise to the occasion, putting aside self-interest forawhile. (If you wantavisceral sense of whatImean, look at the long list of Harvard's dead from the world wars whose names are engraved on the walls of Memorial Church.) Look, noblesse oblige ranks far behind justice asagoal. But it ranks far ahead of Ayn Randian individualism, which in the post-Reagan years seems more and more the dominant flavor of our ruling class.
Here's how Faust put it in her2013open letter rejecting divestment:"We should, moreover, be very wary of steps intended to instrumentalize our endowment in ways that would appear to position the University asapolitical actor rather than an academic institution." Harvard's thenâ "$32.7 billion endowment, she decided, was just morally neutral money. It should not be"a lever to exert economic pressure for social purposes," nor an"instrument to impel social or political change."
But in times of crisis, that's precisely what establishments have done. They've used their resources--from their money to their moral authority to their connections--to step up to the great, unavoidable tasks of the day. And some of them are still trying. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund--descended from the original fossil fuel fortune--last fall announced that it would divest its holdings from fossil fuel. In Britain this year, Prince Charles, the University of Oxford, and the Church of England all started down this divestment path. With the exception apparently of Charles, they did so grudgingly and with much grumbling, but they didn't in the end try to shirk responsibility. Some cord of responsibility, though frayed, still holds there--a cord that may have snapped at Harvard.
Divestment, by the way, is gaining traction. Speaking ataclimate conference in Paris in July, an adviser to the German government and Pope Francis called divestment"a moral decision." Even the head of the World Bank has endorsed it; were Harvard to do the same, its initial reticence would actually add more weight to the decision. It would, in fact, beapowerful political stand. It would say that even here, as we head toward our 400th anniversary, we understand that business as usual is no longer possible. Change has gotta come.
There are all kinds of establishments, of course, and this climate crisis--the greatest conundrum the world has ever wandered into--is testing them all. Pope Francis is plunging the Catholic establishment into the debate, for instance. (So far Georgetown has begun divesting, but Boston College is standing stiff-necked.) I've watched climatologists consider whether the time has come to march and go to jail--I've gone to jail with some of them--and we've seen the divestment debate move up Mass. Ave. to MIT. There, careful, open deliberations have producedarecommendation fromastudent-faculty committee for partial divestment, and action may come this fall. 
It's still possible that Harvard will shift,Iguess--one member of its Board of Overseers, Beneficial State Bank CEO Kat Taylor, used the week of demonstrations and sit-ins last spring to call on the university to do the right thing, so that it could be"the beacon to applicants, students, faculty, and the global community that the world has come to expect." But so far that's been it. Harvard--and Princeton and Brown and most of the other eastern liberal arts colleges--represent what's left of the establishment. In this crucial period ofafew years that will decide the climatic future of the one planet we possess, we need its members to pull up their calf-length socks, unclutch their pearls, and show some residual courage. They need to tug the chain on Wall Street instead of the other way around.

 Harvard, Ye Hypocrites 
 On the global issue that matters most, Harvard University is losing credibility--not to mention money.
By Bill McKibben
Many people remember college only throughaslightly golden haze: the big game, the all-nighter, the favorite professor. It's not malice, this refusal to examine the alma mater too closely--it's just emotionally convenient, especially if you went toaplace like Harvard. For all of its glories--the fascinating fellow students, the wonderful classes--it's hard not to feel uncomfortable with all of what Harvard means. Here's why: The plural of"privilege" is"establishment," and if you graduated from Harvard you're part of one, like it or not. The immediate question is,"How healthy is that establishment?" The answer,Ithink, is not very.
This occurred to me this past April asIspent part of the week stretched out inasleeping bag amid the shrubbery in front of Harvard president Drew Gilpin Faust's office. Hundreds of us--students and faculty, but lots and lots of alumni--were there at some point during Harvard Heat Week to protest the university's refusal to divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies, even as those companies continue to drive us closer to the edge of catastrophic climate change. We weren't asking for anything particularly radical: Institutions ranging from Stanford to Hampshire College, and from the United Church of Christ to the Unitarians, had already started down the divestment path. And in the months since our Harvard protest, they've been joined by everyone from the Episcopal Church to the largest insurance company in France to Norway's government pension fund, a.k.a. the largest sovereign wealth fund on Earth.
But Harvard was different. Despiteastrong organizing effort by students, who in2012convinced nearly three-quarters of their peers to back divestment, the university had issuedaquick initial rejection and refused to budge after faculty members petitioned in 2014. Yes, it was very concerned about climate change. No, it would not divest. In fact, it had offered the back of its hand. In the small corner of its portfolio that is visible to the public, Harvard had (around the time that more than 300,000 people marched in New York for climate action and as the World Council of Churches announced plans to divest) increased its investments in fossil fuel companies byafactor of seven.
Its biggest new investment was inacompany, Anadarko Petroleum, that illustrated every reason thousands of alumni were joining students and faculty in the divestment demand. Not only had the company paid the largest settlement in the history of American environmental contamination cases, but it was alsoabig funder of the political campaigns launched by prominent climate deniers. Above all, though, its basic business plan showed what it thought about global warming: Even though scientists have conclusively demonstrated that no more thanathird of the coal, oil, and gas reserves can be burned if we wish to keep climate change under control, Anadarko boasted to its investors that it expected to"drill nine to12deepwater exploration/appraisal wells focusing on play- opening exploration opportunities in Colombia, Kenya, and the Gulf of Mexico." That is to say, inaworld where by any measure we already have too much carbon, it wanted to find some more. And that's the business plan Harvard was buying into.
When challenged about it, Harvard maintainedanearly perfect unruffled calm. If students surrounded the president's office, the president moved her operations to another building. When demonstrators stagedasit-in at the alumni office, alumni officials gave us baseball caps.
This kind of calm--after2014setarecord for the hottest year ever measured on Earth,arecord that2015is now obliterating-- interested me. It angered me, too,Iconfess, but above all it interested me. What were they thinking? 
Faust--a superb scholar,afine writer, and by all accountsagood president (not to mentionawoman who, in her youth, left school to march in Selma, Alabama)--laid out the university's reasoning in 2013. Some of her points were sensible: Harvard's main job is to research and teach, and in those realms it is doingaremarkable job, for an ever-broader swath of students. But her direct response to divestment was risible. Since the university relies on fossil fuels to power its buildings, transportation, computers, and appliances, she said, there wasa"troubling inconsistency in the notion" of divestment--arguing that, in effect, Harvard could act on the problem only once it had been solved. And her belief that Harvard would instead address climate change in"more effective ways" was unpersuasive. It's sweet that the university"has created awards to recognize 'heroes' who are helping to make Harvard green," but compared with dissolving ice caps, it seems somehow insubstantial. And unconvincing: By this point even the former chairman of Shell has called divestmenta"rational" response to the"distressing" lack of climate action by the big fossil fuel companies.
No, there was something deeper here. Harvard is many things, all of them arguable but one: It's the richest university in the world, what some have calledahedge fund withauniversity attached. That's too cynical, but there's something about Harvard's relationship with money that gets in the way of clear thinking.
Among the highest-paid people at the university, for instance, are its fund managers. In 2013, one of them made $11.5 million, which is $6.1 million more than the University of Alabama shelled out for Nick Saban, the highest-paid college football coach in the country. If you ever groused about the fact that football coaches make more money than professors--well, this one fund manager is paid more than57professors. And that's actually an improvement: Harvard has reined in its compensation fromadecade ago, when some managers were making upward of $30 million.
It's not as if they're irreplaceable financial geniuses, either. To demandasalary like Saban's, most years you'd need to contend for the national championship, or at least the Cotton Bowl. But Harvard's returns are middling at best. Up against the20comparable (though smaller) endowments in 2012, it came in 18th; over the past five years, 19th; over the past decade, 13th. Those aren't Crimson Tide numbers; those are Vanderbilt numbers. Oh, and over the past five years Harvard's returns have trailed, um, index funds. In fact, here's what's really interesting: Investors who have divested from fossil fuel companies have outperformed the broader market for the past five years. If Harvard's managers had paid attention to the students demanding divestment, they'd likely have made the university more money.
But it's less about the return than the ethos. Earlier this year, for instance, Harvard got its biggest gift ever, $400 million to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, from hedge fund manager John Paulson. InaHuffington Post op-ed, economist Jeffrey Sachs argues that Paulson essentially swindled the money from small-scale German investors by convincing Goldman Sachs to set upadesigned-to-fail fund he could then bet against. (Paulson was never charged withacrime.) The dean of Harvard Business School called Paulson the"epitome ofavisionary leader," which inacertain sense is true,Iguess, but not perhaps in the sense he meant.
After decades of sendingalarge number of its graduates to Wall Street, Harvard has actually been good in recent years about expanding the establishment to include people who don't look like the inbred scions who once dominated it. But the university's domination by Wall Street seems to have eroded the few valuable things an establishment offers--above all the idea that inatime of crisis it would rise to the occasion, putting aside self-interest forawhile. (If you wantavisceral sense of whatImean, look at the long list of Harvard's dead from the world wars whose names are engraved on the walls of Memorial Church.) Look, noblesse oblige ranks far behind justice asagoal. But it ranks far ahead of Ayn Randian individualism, which in the post-Reagan years seems more and more the dominant flavor of our ruling class.
Here's how Faust put it in her2013open letter rejecting divestment:"We should, moreover, be very wary of steps intended to instrumentalize our endowment in ways that would appear to position the University asapolitical actor rather than an academic institution." Harvard's thenâ "$32.7 billion endowment, she decided, was just morally neutral money. It should not be"a lever to exert economic pressure for social purposes," nor an"instrument to impel social or political change."
But in times of crisis, that's precisely what establishments have done. They've used their resources--from their money to their moral authority to their connections--to step up to the great, unavoidable tasks of the day. And some of them are still trying. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund--descended from the original fossil fuel fortune--last fall announced that it would divest its holdings from fossil fuel. In Britain this year, Prince Charles, the University of Oxford, and the Church of England all started down this divestment path. With the exception apparently of Charles, they did so grudgingly and with much grumbling, but they didn't in the end try to shirk responsibility. Some cord of responsibility, though frayed, still holds there--a cord that may have snapped at Harvard.
Divestment, by the way, is gaining traction. Speaking ataclimate conference in Paris in July, an adviser to the German government and Pope Francis called divestment"a moral decision." Even the head of the World Bank has endorsed it; were Harvard to do the same, its initial reticence would actually add more weight to the decision. It would, in fact, beapowerful political stand. It would say that even here, as we head toward our 400th anniversary, we understand that business as usual is no longer possible. Change has gotta come.
There are all kinds of establishments, of course, and this climate crisis--the greatest conundrum the world has ever wandered into--is testing them all. Pope Francis is plunging the Catholic establishment into the debate, for instance. (So far Georgetown has begun divesting, but Boston College is standing stiff-necked.) I've watched climatologists consider whether the time has come to march and go to jail--I've gone to jail with some of them--and we've seen the divestment debate move up Mass. Ave. to MIT. There, careful, open deliberations have producedarecommendation fromastudent-faculty committee for partial divestment, and action may come this fall. 
It's still possible that Harvard will shift,Iguess--one member of its Board of Overseers, Beneficial State Bank CEO Kat Taylor, used the week of demonstrations and sit-ins last spring to call on the university to do the right thing, so that it could be"the beacon to applicants, students, faculty, and the global community that the world has come to expect." But so far that's been it. Harvard--and Princeton and Brown and most of the other eastern liberal arts colleges--represent what's left of the establishment. In this crucial period ofafew years that will decide the climatic future of the one planet we possess, we need its members to pull up their calf-length socks, unclutch their pearls, and show some residual courage. They need to tug the chain on Wall Street instead of the other way around.

A Snowball's Chance
As global temperatures rise, the New England ski industry is in danger of totally melting away--and sooner than you think.
By Madison Kahn
It's perfect ski weather: sunny, blue skies, and just cold enough to see your breath. I'm standing in the parking lot of southern Vermont's Hogback Mountain alongside Jeremy Davis,ameteorologist and connoisseur of old New England ski areas. As we strap on our snowshoes, he tells me that50years ago, Hogback--a two-hour drive from Boston--wasaveritable hot spot, teeming with skiers.
Plodding across the mountain's narrow trails,Iimagine hordes of New Englanders--harried moms and dads with their stocking-capped kids--bustling onto the slopes from the small parking lot, like something out ofaRockwell painting. With14trails and T-bars that could tow 4,300 skiers per hour, Hogback Mountain was one of the region's premier family ski destinations.
ThenItrip onatree root, falling hard on the dirt. Davis stops every few minutes to remove the rocks caught in his snowshoes. Under our feet, we realize, is not the powder you'd expect onaski hill, butashallow crust of ice and snow. We haven't gone more thanamile before we decide to abandon our snowshoes completely. Hogback, it turns out, has been closed for decades, doomed byalack of snow and the rising costs of runningaski resort. The trouble started in the 1970s, when scientists say that temperatures began to rise significantly (in truth, there was little climate research done before then).Aseries of spotty seasons, coupled with the sharp spike in gas prices brought on by the1973oil crisis, hit the mountain hard. It finally shuttered for good in 1986.
Now in boots, Davis andIcontinue exploring the mountainside. We look for the lift line, usually the clearest path to the summit, but Hogback's forest has already swallowed much of the mountain's infrastructure.Afew remaining artifacts jut out eerily, serving as haunting signs of the mountain's former life. The Ford engine that once powered its main rope tow sits tangled in brush next toalopsided, aluminum-roofed red shack. The whole hut leans to the left; the slightest breath, it seems, could blow the entire thing over. We climb through overgrown weeds and fallen trees, following abandoned lift towers toward what we hope is the peak. Before long, we can see Mount Snow in the distance, its broad trails swarming with skiers.
Hogback and Mount Snow are not so different. Just15miles apart, both ski areas are located in the middle of what was not long ago part of the Northeast's 120-inch Snowbelt. Why did one die and the other prosper? Simple economics: Mount Snow could afford the snowmaking technology needed to stay open when temperatures began to rise. Hogback couldn't.
But making enough snow is becoming an increasingly difficult proposition. Due to accelerating climate change, Mount Snow faces the very real prospect of one day becoming another Hogback, ghostly and abandoned. Almost600U.S. ski areas have disappeared in the past60years, many of them victims of warmer winters. In fact, if warming trends continue at their current rates, within the next few decades, the multibillion-dollar New England ski industry could collapse entirely.
Since 1970, the average global temperature has increased 0.5 degrees per decade. By the end of the century, northeastern winter temperatures are expected to rise between four and10degrees, effectively cutting New England's snow season in half. Scientists at the University of Waterloo, in Ontario, recently studied the effects of climate change on the northeastern ski industry and discovered alarming results: If global emissions continue to rise at current rates, in30years only about half of the103ski areas in the Northeast covered by the study will be able to maintain the 100-day season they need to be sustainable--and none of them is in Massachusetts.
Of the resorts able to stay open, at least75percent will require substantial artificial snowmaking to survive, which, in turn, will significantly increase operational costs and lift-ticket prices. To put it bluntly, within our lifetime, researchers say only34ski areas across the entire Northeast will be viable.
And even if those few ski areas can make enough snow to survive, they'll suffer from the lack of flakes elsewhere. Researchers at the University of New Hampshire have found evidence ofapsychological"backyard" effect: City dwellers are less inclined to drive somewhere to ski when there's no snow in their own neighborhood. This could have serious implications for ski areas that rely on day-trip traffic from feeder cities like Boston and New York. It doesn't help that, according to the University of Waterloo study, the few remaining mountains will be so far north that Bostonians may have to drive five hours to reach them--or they just won't.
Already we've seen evidence ofawarmer climate's effect on the industry. Today, about95percent of resorts worldwide use snowmaking to supplement natural snow. Half of U.S. ski areas are opening late and closing early--and in the past50years, the average season length has decreased by seven days. Asaresult, the national $12.2 billion winter tourism industry has lost more thanabillion dollars in revenue and eliminated as many as 27,000 jobs over the past decade, according toareport issued in December2012by the Natural Resources Defense Council andagroup called Protect Our Winters. In the West, the increased volume of water required for snowmaking is creating conflicts over water use, and in due time, the same could happen in the Northeast.
Here in New England, the loss of the ski industry would be acutely felt: Northeastern ski resorts record more than13million skier visits per season--the highest of any region in the country--and help prop up many related businesses, including apparel, boot, and gear companies (to say nothing of mountainside restaurants, shops, and hotels). Snow sports contribute billions every year to the region's economy and employ as many as 46,000 people. Even just tacking onafew more inches of snow toaregular season--and perhaps extending it byacouple of weeks--can translate into an additional $13 million in revenue. But those days seem to be waning. With snowy winters no longer the norm, the University of Waterloo's scientific models suggest that northeastern ski areas will lose $3.2 billion in annual revenue over the next40years.
The National Ski Association, now known as the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, was founded in 1905. But the sport didn't catch on until the '40s, when European instructors began offering ski lessons through the Appalachian Mountain Club and at northeastern universities like Dartmouth. In the wake of the1960Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, eager baby boomers built rope tows in towns and at private schools across New England.Adecade later, as many as60ski areas existed within an hour's drive of Boston. Today, there are three.
When it opened in 1947, at the peak of New England's ski boom, Hogback Mountain wasaprime destination for city skiers. The mountain's last owner, 91-year-old Dick Hamilton, is almost as old as the sport itself. On the dayImet him in his quaint white Marlboro farmhouse, he was sporting his old Hogback Mountain Ski Area beanie."I've been wearing this hat to Stratton ever since Hogback died," Hamilton said."And every day, people come up to me and say, 'Hey,Ilearned to ski there.'"
Hamilton's first experience on the slopes was onapair of maple skis--he put them to use in 1947, when his sweetheart's father opened Hogback."Snow was pretty much always here during those times," he said. Every weekend, Hamilton told me, both sides of Route9were lined with license plates from Canada and all over the northeastern United States. The parked cars left barely enough room for the squadrons of Greyhound buses, carting eager New Yorkers and Bostonians. It cost as little as $5aday to ride the rope tow, which could serve900skiers per hour, the highest-capacity T-bar in the East at that time. Only14trails were open for Hogback's 1,200 daily visitors (most larger ski areas today have more than 100), but that was enough to serve the mountain's prime customers: families, who paid $260 foraseason pass. After Hamilton bought Hogback at its peak in the early '70s, it quickly grew into what Vermont Life magazine described as the"biggest little area in New England."
Withinadecade, however, the mountain's annual snow-packed winters had grown few and far between."I remember one year we didn't open until February," Hamilton said."And by then, people had made their commitment to other areas." Those"other areas" were hills with the snowmaking technology that Hogback lacked. To make matters worse, the cost of liability insurance was skyrocketing. Forasmall family ski area with reasonable prices, Hogback couldn't afford to stay open amid sparse winters.
Many other mountains in the vicinity followedasimilar trajectory--29 ski areas in southern Vermont closed over the decades. Today, there are roughly115ghost mountains in the state. Massachusetts has even more: 173.
Now, it's the remaining midsize mom-and-pop mountains that are most in danger. Blandford Ski Area, in western Massachusetts, is one such high-risk spot. Opened in 1936, Blandford is the oldest continually operating, club-owned ski area in North America. Every member isapartial owner, and therefore has an obligation to contribute some of their time during the winter months, helping with upkeep, ticket sales, rentals, and running the lift. Most of the people who ski Blandford live within an hour's drive and bring their entire family each time they go, which can be as often as five timesaweek. But just because kids learn the sport at Blandford doesn't mean they continue skiing there as adults."We joke that all the big ski areas owe usabuck for every lift ticket they sell, because we ship them our kids," said Jay Pagluica,aformer president and board member at Blandford who still hangs around as the hill's unofficial grandfather figure.
In the '60s, there wasawaitlist for Blandford's 5,000 ski-club spots--the rope tows could only handle so much traffic. Now membership is half that. Costs went up when Blandford installed snowmaking technology in the '80s, and ever since it's beenastruggle to pay for the mountain's regular maintenance while keeping tickets low enough for locals to afford."We've got to have snow on the mountain to get open," Pagluica said."And the windows to make snow are getting smaller and smaller." WhenIasked Pagluica if the resort hadafive-year plan, he grew silent:"We just want to open next year."
As smaller ski areas went out of business, the mountains that had money to invest in snowmaking ramped up operations. And if their costs were being driven up by churning out all that powder, they initially found more than enough ways to make it back: Mountains were rapidly turning themselves into luxury resorts. Beginning in the late '70s, Maine's Sunday River, run by industry mogul Les Otten, led the charge, shelling out for high-speed chairlifts, wider trails,abase lodge, restaurants, and hotels. Other resorts quickly followed suit. Withinafew years, New England's sleepy ski hills had grown into five-star resorts, effectively turning the sport into the multibillion-dollar winter tourism industry we recognize today.
Now, as temperatures rise, the industry is experiencing another shift, and doing its best to adapt. Many mountains are going green--not so much to save the environment, but to save money. Snowmaking, after all, is very expensive, and the need for it is only growing. Sunday River's snowmaking system, for instance, covers92percent of the resort's616acres. The mountain's owners already pour $500,000 to $1 million every year into new energy-efficient snow guns, which they hope will offset the high costs of snow production."It's incredibly important to us to keep our system as fresh and efficient as possible," says Darcy Morse, the mountain's communications director."Snowmaking is so much of what Sunday River is known for and does."
The mountain is cutting costs and energy in other ways too: It installed low-flow showers and toilets to save water,awastewater treatment center to reduce runoff, and introduced hornpout fish into their lagoons to decrease sludge.
Medium-size ski areas like Massachusetts' Jiminy Peak Mountain Resort and Wachusett Mountain Ski Area are also coming up with environmentally sustainable, energy-efficient solutions to adapt to warming temperatures. In 2007, Jiminy installedamassive wind turbine, which now provides one-third of the resort's power."Not everyone needsawind turbine," says Jim Van Dyke, the mountain's vice president of environmental sustainability. But they do need, he continued, the money and will to invest in expensive, but cost-saving, measures.
Wachusett, located just over an hour west of Boston, has also taken the green route to save money. Over the past several years, the resort has installed two 1.5-megawatt wind turbines to cover40percent of the resort town's energy needs. The mountain converts100percent of its cooking oil into biodiesel to fuel its five snowcat grooming vehicles. Wachusett's most unique and innovative"greening" mechanism is capturing the heat thrown off by their snowmakers and using it to help warm the base lodge. Operators also market the mountain asamulti-seasonal resort. By offering festivals, weddings, races, and concerts in the summer and fall, Wachusett makes about10percent of its revenue in the off-season.
In season, though, the ski industry has essentially developed into an arms race to see who can develop the most efficient snow-making technology. Wachusett's president, Jeff Crowley, calls himselfasnow farmer:"We have to make hay when the sun shines," he says. Wachusett has spent halfamillion dollars per year on snowmaking over the past decade. But with the sun shining brighter and warmer than ever before, at what point does the whole proposition simply become too expensive?
It'saprospect that some mountain loyalists simply cannot bring themselves to confront--even as the industry evaporates around them. Crowley admits that he's preparing for change, and is working hard to stay optimistic, even if it means indulging in some wishful thinking."We have our fingers crossed, hoping that maybe we're all wrong about this stuff," he says."Sure, the climate is changing, butIdon't think it's going to be drastic enough that we're going to be without snow all winter.Ifind myself listening more to the guys who are saying all of this climate-change stuff is not necessarily true." For Crowley, optimism has becomeacoping mechanism."We kind of have to put our blinders on," he says."Otherwise we would just want to sell our resort."

Even in the first100days of the Walsh administration, there are signs that ideas matter. 
Better Together
 Marty Walsh Mayor, City of Boston
Leadingacity requires more than just power, and winning elections requires more than merely growing one's base. That's especially true here in Boston, where the traditional bases of political power are rapidly shifting, and change isagiven. Voters are smarter. Ideas matter to them. And even in the first100days, there are signs that ideas matter to the Walsh administration. That Boston is stronger when it looks outside its borders. Thatamodern city should stay open late and public transit should keep up. Thatapolice force, andagovernment, should reflect the city it serves.
To say that the mayor of Boston belongs on Boston magazine's power list is self-evident. The more interesting question--the fascinating idea at the heart of this issue--is how he got here in the first place. The idea was simple: To help yourself, help everyone else. Walsh began by helping his union brothers and sisters--asamember, an advocate, and thenaleader. Asastate rep, he helped his constituents within the enormous neighborhood of Dorchester, where about20percent of the city's residents reside. As someone who's been sober since 1995, he helped countless others in recovery, something he quietly continues to this day. Not surprisingly, these people became his groundswell--his army. 
When it was time for his own race for mayor, Walsh's army fought for their own. By that time, they realized it was their fight. Because power need not be hoarded by one; it can be harvested to empower many. --Mike Ross, former city councilor and mayoral candidate
Defending the Middle Class
Elizabeth Warren
Senator
"Today the game is rigged," Warren writes in her new memoir,AFighting Chance,"rigged to work for those who have money and power." The game of which she speaks, of course, is America. And inafew short years, Warren's ideas--that Wall Street banks and big corporations are screwing the middle class, and that Washington is little more thanalobbyist watering hole--have transformed progressive politics, not just in New England but around the country."Whether or not Elizabeth Warren ever runs for the presidency," The Nation opined recently,"she is teaching her partyagreat deal about how to take the events ofamoment and weave them intoanarrative."
Going to Bat for Journalism's Future 
John Henry
Owner, the Boston Globe
When Henry struckadeal to buy the Boston Globe last fall, it wasahome run for the long-suffering news business. With his checkbook, Henry made the point that great journalism is worth investing in. And from his newfound pulpit, he declared not only that journalism could be saved--but also that the Globe would become the laboratory driving its resurrection. How? Well, absentasilver-bullet solution, he's overhauled management to bring in big-thinking talent from both the advertising and media worlds, and embarked onastring of innovative products:anew, standalone Catholic news site,arebooted Boston.com, and the possibility ofaGlobe TV station. Who knows if those particular ideas will work, but one thing is certain: There will be more of them.
Boston's Global Future
John Fish Chairman and CEO, Suffolk 
Fish has hadaperennial place on our list. Let's face it: During the Menino mayoralty, he was the man to know. Now he's heading up Boston's2024Olympic bid, and rethinking the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce as its new chairman. We asked Boston's biggest builder why he's throwing his energy at these two projects. 
On Bringing the Olympics to Boston
"I start with the question: What is the city of Boston going to look like in30or40years? It involves thinking big--not just thinking about where we've been and where we're going, but thinkingalittle abnormally. We may never realize the Olympics in 2024, but the opportunity to bring the community together to talk about the future isapowerful thing."
On Rethinking the Chamber of Commerce
"We need to think about how we haveaconversation about regionalization--Idon't think it's helpful to takeaBoston-centric point of view. If we help out other communities in Massachusetts, and if those areas do well, Boston will be the beneficiary of their success. And that will enhance opportunities for all."
Seeing isn't believing
Errol Morris
Documentary Filmmaker
As an author, Morris has been obsessed with the notion that photographs often lie. His documentaries are obsessed with lies, too, like the Oscar-winning The Fog of War (2003), about Vietnam War architect Robert ­McNamara, and The Thin Blue Line (1988), which garnered the release ofaTexas inmate on death row. His latest, The Unknown Known, focuses on another icon of infallible self-truths: Donald Rumsfeld. Morris has an uncanny ability to probe and wait out his interviewees until they reveal surprising insights... or hang themselves. 
Venture Culturalism
Yo-Yo Ma
Cellist
The Cambridge-based classical-music superstar is one of the country's most eloquent voices on the idea that culture is essential forahealthy democracy."The arts," Ma told an audience at the Kennedy Center last April,"foster the four critical skills necessary for our children to succeed in the 21st-century workforce: collaboration, flexibility, imagination, innovation." 
Democratizing education
Anant Agarwal
CEO, edX
When edX launched in 2012, it floatedabig, bold, revolutionary concept: Give away Harvard and MIT's prestigious courses online, for free, to anyone in the world. Two years later, the concept of MOOCs--"massive open online courses"-- is transforming higher education, both inside and outside the classroom. Today, edX has more than130"blended" courses, in which teachers supplement in-class exercises with videos, virtual labs, and gamification. Agarwal sees future classrooms as interactive environments. And that future is not far off. 
Know your roots 
Henry Louis Gates
Harvard Professor
A pioneer in the field of African- American studies, Gates has long been one of the nation's preeminent thinkers about the nexus of ancestry and culture. His influence spans mediums--he wasaconsultant on12YearsaSlave, isacofounder of the online magazine the Root, and hostsaPBS series on genealogy.Adonor's recent $15 million gift to consolidate Harvard's African and African-American studies programs only expands his reach. If there'sacentral tenet to all of Gates's work, it's this: To understand yourself, you need to know where you came from. 
History Matters
Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jill Lepore
Historians
If anyone in Boston is making the case that academic ideas matter in the real world, it's historians Kearns Goodwin (pictured) and Lepore, who are to historical scholarship what Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis were to jazz: two very different kinds of genius whose shared art form has become crucial to the culture at large. Back in 2008, Senator Barack Obama devoured Kearns Goodwin's presidential biographies--especially her book on Lincoln, Team of Rivals--which many say influenced his choice to ­appoint Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Meanwhile, Lepore writes onawider variety of subjects, from King Philip's War to the modern Tea Party movement, but it's clear she takes her role just as seriously."To beapublic historian," she wrote recently,"is to beakeeper of our memory asapeople." Between the two of them, it seems like we're in good hands.
The web's next25Years 
Tim Berners-Lee, Larry Lessig, and Nicholas Negroponte
It's easy to forget that the Web, as we know it, was born here. This past March, MIT professor Tim Berners-Lee marked the 25th anniversary of his groundbreaking invention--and he continues to beavocal, thoughtful arbiter of its future, having recently proposed an online Magna Carta to encode values to the Web. Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig's career is grounded in his role as an Internet crusader. He revolutionized intellectual property and copyright law, advocated for net neutrality, and has now set his sights on the corrosive influence of money in politics. Nicholas Negroponte is looking forward: The MIT Media Lab and One Laptop Per Child founder has plans to use stationary satellites to expand Web access to"the last billion" people without the Internet.
Making Healthcare Accessible to All
Joseph Betancourt 
Director, the Disparities Solutions Center at Mass General
Betancourt realized early in his career that all the medical advances in the world mean nothing when racial and ethnic inequality plagues our healthcare system. So in 2004, Betancourt petitioned Massachusetts General Hospital to create the Disparities Solutions Center, which then launched the following year to address the barriers that were keeping his patients from getting adequate care. Since then, he's persuaded MGH to installa"disparities dashboard," which tracks how the hospital treats patients of varied cultural backgrounds. Betancourt also teaches cross-cultural medicine at Harvard Medical School, heads the department of multicultural education at MGH, and cofounded Quality Interactions, an e-learning company that, so far, has trained more than 130,000 physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other stakeholders. He's leading the healthcare industry in creating cross-cultural competence.--Marcela Garcia
Curing The rare diseases that Big Pharma won't
Mark Levin, Kevin Starr, and Bob Tepper 
Third Rock Ventures
This Boston-based venture firm doesn't just fund biotech and medical innovation, it creates it--finding the world's top scientific talent and building companies around their ideas. Since launching in 2007, it has raised $1.3 billion and helped create31companies that are now working on life-changing cures for ALS, cancer, and various orphan diseases. In the process, it's energizing the city's biotech pipeline.
Buildingabetter principal
Carolyn and Peter Lynch 
The Lynch Foundation
Fixing Boston's public school system has becomeafixation for the Lynches, who donated $2.5 million last year to help createanew leadership model. The Aspiring Principal Program isaresidency that will partner outstanding classroom teachers with successful principals for intense on-site training. Together they're buildinganew educational infrastructure.
Determining the future of American Energy
Ernest Moniz
U.S. Secretary of Energy 
I first met Ernie10years ago when we were onaNational Academy of Sciences panel discussing the transportation of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain, andIlast saw him at Cardullo's, in Harvard Square, where he tried to convince me that fracking wasa"proven" technology that mitigates climate change. He'saFall River native, MIT professor, and nuclear physicist with an unfaltering faith that technology will deliveraclean-energy future. Serving as the U.S. secretary of energy since May 2013, he's beenakeen proponent of both fracking and nuclear power, but critics point out his close ties with the oil and gas industries, particularly in relation to their funding of the MIT Energy Initiative. As such, he's been dubbed"the man in the middle," having to balance the Obama administration's increasingly strong stance on climate change with the needs ofastrident energy industry. In truth, Ernie's positions on the environment matter to us all.--Julian Agyeman, professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning, Tufts
Crowd sourcing disaster relief
Caitria and Morgan O'Neill 
Recovers
In 2011, armed with little more than liberal arts degrees and empathy, the O'Neill sisters responded toatornado in their hometown of Monson, Massachusetts, by spearheading donation and volunteer coordination out ofalocal church. The experience inspired them to create Recovers,awebsite where people can find instant updates, track local volunteer hours, and manage spontaneous donations. Since its2012launch, the"Twister Sisters" have helped28disaster-relief efforts and proved critical during Hurricane Sandy, enabling four New York City neighborhoods to coordinate 20,000 volunteers and donors.
Electing Women to higher office
Barbara Lee
Barbara Lee Foundation
If America electsawoman to be its next president, she'll have Lee to thank. Since 1999, Lee's foundation has been obsessed with training the next generation of female leaders to enter elective politics. You may have heard of some of her protégées--Elizabeth Warren, Wendy Davis, Martha Coakley. Lee has always been focused on building the long-term ladder to the political peak, and that work has kept growing. Vermont just became the 14th state withachapter of Lee's Emerge America, which trains women to enter elective politics.
Challenging Our Thinking on Disability and Design
 Sara Hendren
Artist, the Accessible Icon Project
When Hendren looked at the ubiquitous wheelchair symbol, designed in the late 1960s, she sawastatic, passive figure seemingly trapped in its chair. So in 2011, the Cambridge artist and writer, along with collaborator Brian Glenney, started placing translucent stickers that depictedaperson in motion--arms back, head and upper body thrust forward--over existing handicap signs. Their guerilla art efforts developed into the Accessible Icon Project, and has since been adopted by the Bronx Zoo, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the University of Arizona, and inducted into the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. Hendren says the graphic sparks conversations:"It'saprovocation-- an invitation to think, 'What are my preconceived notions about people with disabilities?'" 
Groundbreaking Spacemaking
Tim Love Founder, Utile Architecture + Planning
The president-elect of the Boston Society of Architects has set his sights on revamping the entire design industry. Instead of waiting for commissions, Love is actively imagining what Boston should look like--and developing public-private partnerships to bring innovative urban ideas to fruition. It'saradical shift away from how development has been done in Boston for the past20years...but it's working. From rethinking Chinatown's development approach to finding creative ways to save Fort Point's historical buildings, Love's architectural ambitions know no bounds. Next on his agenda? Redesigning City Hall Plaza.
Collaborative Care
Betsy Nabel 
President, Brigham and Women's Hospital
You'll never find Nabel on an elevator; the cardiologist wasaresident at the Brigham long before she became its president, and her heart-healthy habit is to always take the stairs. Today, Nabel's taking steps to shape how the academic hospital will look and function by overseeing the design of the Brigham Building for the Future. In the planned 11-story, LEED Goldâ "certified structure, clinical research and patient care will occur side by side, fostering what Nabel calls"collisions of collaborations." Having researchers, clinicians, and educators in close proximity will not only allow the hospital to better use its resources, she argues, it will also transform healthcare."The future of medicine starts here," she says.
The Tedx Effect
TEDxBoston curator Danielle Duplin has been spotting trends in business and technology since the local spinoff of the speaking series first launched in 2009. Here, she recalls five of her favorite ideas from the past five years.
Lab onaStamp
Harvard chemist George Whitesides's medical diagnostics lab is the size ofapostage stamp and can cheaply and effectively detect common ailments for people in resource-limited settings.
Open-Source Drug Development 
Cancer researcher Jay Bradner"gave away" the formula for his JQ1 molecule that reprograms cancer cells in hopes that an open-source drug discovery model will get treatments to market faster than the current pharma methods.
NeoNurture Infant Incubator
Timothy Prestero, the CEO of Design That Matters, repurposed discarded car parts to build an infant incubator for people in the developing world. His award-winning invention has treated more than 1,000 babies in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Ghana.
Urban housing
The brilliantly imagined responsive homes and folding cars from MIT's Kent Larson will be able to fit more people comfortably into ever-growing urban areas--a wonderful application of technology in the service of humanity.
Organs on Chips
By demonstrating how drug testing on human organs can be simulated on microchips, Harvard scientist Geraldine Hamilton explores the not-too-distant future of personalized medicine and drug research.
Equality Starts Here
Ayanna Pressley City Councilor at Large
"Every morning,Ipray, drink coffee, put on red stilettos, and head out to change the world." That's Pressley's unique approach to getting things done. Everyone wanted her to run for something this past year--mayor, statewide office, even federal office. Instead she's intent on tackling some of Boston's toughest issues: improving the lives of women in the city; overhauling sex education in schools; and fighting the root causes of economic disparity, from liquor-license reform to discriminatory hiring practices. Pressley also launched the Elevate Boston coalition to encourage mayoral candidates to focus on women's and LGBT issues. No matter where she goes next, her powerful social-justice agenda will follow.
Go-big-or- go-home diplomacy
John Kerry
U.S. Secretary of State
Speaking of the Middle East peace talks, an anonymous Western official told Haaretz last May,"Sometimes there'safeeling that Kerry thinks the only reason his predecessors in the job didn't bring aboutapeace agreement is that they weren't John Kerry." Some would argue it's precisely that idealism that's been missing from American foreign policy."I may fail.Idon't care. It's worth doing," Kerry has said of the talks. No matter how intractable the situation or belligerent the players, Kerry bounds onto the scene believing he can negotiateasolution. And now, unburdened by the pursuit of higher office, he's free to set his own course.
Creating the next generation of peacemakers
Eric Dawson
President and Cofounder, Peace First
It's tempting to shield children from the world's harshest realities, but Dawson sees the innocence of youth as an opportunity to foster positive change. Over the past13years, Dawson has transformed Peace First intoanational institution that teaches and supports peacemaking skills. At last year's Clinton Global Initiative, it launched the Peace First Prize--a $25,000 annual award given to five to10kids, ages eight to 22, for their grassroots initiatives to prevent bullying, stop gun violence, and fight injustice. Through the prize, Peace First aims to create the next generation of thought leaders. 
Smart Growth
John Barros
Chief of Economic Development, City of Boston
After showing off his deep policy knowledge in an underdog campaign for mayor, Barros has becomeahousehold name in Boston. But his wide-ranging expertise, from housing to education to public safety, is nothing new to City Hall insiders. Now, tapped by Mayor Marty Walsh to head the city's economic development, Barros will get to apply his progressive but pragmatic approach to every corner of the city."I would argue he probably has the most powerful economic position in the city of Boston right now to makeadifference going forward," says John Fish.
The City as Urban Laboratory
Joe Curtatone 
Mayor of Somerville
Since taking office in 2004, Curtatone has been at the vanguard of municipal governance. He fixedacrippling budget deficit usingahomegrown data analytics tool, SomerStat, and overhauled the city's constituent services center. Somerville's economy is booming, and Curtatone is campaigning for more growth--from Legoland in Assembly Square to the long-delayed Green Line extension. It seems his penchant for adopting new ideas is paying off: Curtatone was just named an Ash Fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School to help teach others how it's done.
Championing Boston's Creative Class
Greg Selkoe and Malia Lazu
Future Boston 
Selkoe, founder of the online streetwear empire Karmaloop andaformer BRA staffer, often tangled with Mayor Menino. Boston, Selkoe argued, just wasn't fun enough. Frivolous? Not really. Future Boston, the nonprofit he runs with activist Malia Lazu, has been responsible for turning"fun" intoacampaign issue­ and pushing to make the cityaplace where young professionals can thrive.
Museums Must Support Themselves
Dan Monroe
Director and CEO, Peabody Essex Museum
Even without Malcolm Rogers's impending retirement from the MFA, Dan Monroe would be the lead candidate for the region's most dynamic museum director. Since taking the helm of the Peabody Essex in 1993, Monroe has overhauled the model for museum stewardship--knowing it's no longer enough to rely on gift-shop sales and annual contributions to keep an institution afloat. He's increased the museum's budget from $3.4 million to $24 million and aims to grow its endowment to $630 million--ensuring that the PEM's funding sources will remain solvent if the whims of the market (or less-­engaged young patrons) affect the bottom line. The PEM's forthcoming $650 million renovation will push the institution into the top10museums in the country in terms of gallery space, and Monroe's dream team of curatorial talent will undoubtably use it, as they continue to bring groundbreaking exhibits to Salem year after year.
Empowered and Engaged Mothers Are the Key to Ending Violence
Monalisa Smith and Kim Odom President, Mothers for Justice and Equity; Pastor and Peace Activist 
They are known simply as"The Mothers"--the survivors left standing after their children were taken from them by Boston's plague of urban violence--and inafew short years they have createdapower base out of powerlessness. Together, Smith (left) and Odom have reshaped the way Boston responds to trauma, using strategies that are"grounded," as they've written,"in the principles of restorative justice, an approach promoting the belief that healing through social connectivity and engagement will prevent street violence and lead to healthier, more vibrant communities." The mothers have built, from their grief,agrassroots movement that seeks to hold the rest of the city accountable whenalife is lost--and attempts to make the city whole again.
MAKE big plans
Deval Patrick
Governor
For proof of Patrick's impact on American politics, look no further than the White House: Many of the ideas that led to Obama's election were on display during Patrick's2006campaign. In his eight years in office, he's governed by championing big plans like expanding healthcare, attackingadecades-long transportation crisis, and pushing for the development of our technology, life-science, and clean-energy sectors, which not only helped generate jobs but also kept us at the forefront of the nation's economic recovery. Beacon Hill insiders have long whispered that Patrick just doesn't get their politics, while true believers and cynics alike have speculated that his future was too bright for him to stick around. And yet he has. He's the only multiterm governor to serve the state without seeking higher office in almost150years, and along the way, he has made an impact that will be felt for years to come. But I'd argue that his power isn't in what he's done as much as in how he's done it. He has made us believe once again that service and big ideas haveaplace in political life, and in so doing inspiredageneration of grassroots activists, first-time candidates, and everyday idealists to takeachance onacouple of big ideas of our own. --Liz Morningstar, CEO, Boston Public Market 
Food For Thought
Six local ideas that are changing how we eat.
The growers
Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara
President and CEO, Freight Farms
The idea. Making new space to grow food--anywhere.
It's now possible to cultivateabounty of fresh, local produce miles from the nearest farm--if you have access toa"Leafy Green Machine." Designed by Friedman and McNamara from"upcycled" shipping containers, Freight Farms come ready-made with high-tech hydroponic equipment suitable for growing leafy veggies and herbs like basil, arugula, and kale in any climate. Freight Farms may have started locally, but its mobile units are now cropping up everywhere from San Antonio, Texas, to Edina, Minnesota.
Courtney Hennessy and John Stoddard
Cofounders, Higher Ground Farm
the IDEA Bringing urban farming to new heights.
The merits of rooftop gardening are obvious: optimal sun exposure for produce, reduced cooling and insulation costs for the building, easy access to quality product. Now imagine those effects onahuge scale--the Boston Design Center's 55,000-square-foot roof. Since debuting last spring, Higher Ground's output has landed on the menus of high-profile local restaurants like Neptune Oyster, Tavern Road, and Tres Gatos. 
The producers
Darnell Adams, Brad Stevens, and Roz Freeman
Managing Director, Executive Chef, and Operations Manager, CropCircle Kitchen
The idea. Letting small food businesses think big.
Since 2009, CropCircle Kitchen has launched startups by providing shared cooking and storage space in Jamaica Plain. The demand has been so great that this spring the team will openanew 36,000-square-foot facility in Dorchester. To learn more about the enormous undertaking, turn to page 104.
Michael Leviton
Chef, Lumière, Area Four, and A4 Pizza Bar
The idea. Sustainability, one dish atatime.
Terms like"local,""sustainable," and"seasonal" areaway of life for Leviton (pictured). As the chair of the board of Chefs Collaborative,anational coalition of sustainability-minded tastemakers, he helps chefs around the country make positive changes in their restaurants, from sourcing antibiotic-free meat to choosing less-heavily-fished seafood selections.
The servers
Ashley Stanley 
Founder and CEO, Lovin' Spoonfuls
The idea. Getting excess food to the hungry. 
Stanley started her food-rescue nonprofit Lovin' Spoonfuls in2010withasingle insulated truck. Four years later, she's now up toafleet of four, and is on track to rescue one million pounds of excess food in 2014. The trucks travel throughout Greater Boston picking up overstock at large-shelf grocers and farms, then redistribute it to organizations like Rosie's Place and the Pine Street Inn. Now Stanley has plans to expand throughout the state, and eventually across the country.
Doug Rauch
Founder and CEO, the Daily Table
The idea.Arestaurant serving expired food.
Here'sadirty little secret: Food that's past its sell-by date isn't necessarily spoiled. In fact, with the Daily Table, former Trader Joe's CEO Doug Rauch has decided to sell wholesome, nutrient-rich, ready-made meals made with food that's past its prime. This summer he'll opena9,000-square-foot takeout restaurant meets grocery store in Dorchester, utilizing past-sell-date food and excess product from farms and large-scale retailers to help keep costs down.Arecent Harvard study gave the practiceathumbs-up. Waste not, want not. 
Play to win
Michael Porter 
Professor, Harvard Business School
Porter may be among the most preeminent business professors on the planet--he's the mastermind behind the concept of competitive advantage--but the power of his ideas reaches way beyond Wall Street. Healthcare reformers are currently using his methods to reframe how they deliver care, and nations use his Social Progress Index to measure the well-being of their citizens. Considering that our own country ranked 16th on his index, Porter, through his U.S. Competitive Project at Harvard, is now bringing together thought leaders to strategize on how to keep America at the front of an increasingly global, industrialized, and, yes, competitive economy.
Be An Anti-Disciplinarian
Joi Ito
Director, MIT's Media Lab
Ito runs MIT's Media Lab, the city's foremost Râ  &â  D think tank and the nexus of business, science, and innovation in Boston. He's alsoarave DJ who swims with sharks. But Ito's real talent is making connections. As head of the lab, his policy for faculty members is that they be"anti-disciplinary.""To me," he told Wired magazine,"there'sascience to community building." In practice, the community Ito has built is turning out such sci-fi marvels as printable genes, snap-together electronic components, and wristbands that measure emotions. Their work pulls in the city's best raw materials--capital, brainpower, technology--that drive so many of our best ideas into its orbit.
Media Matters
Ann Marie Lipinski Curator, Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
As The First female curator of Harvard's Nieman Foundation, the Pulitzer Prizeâ "winning writer and editor is drawing the world's top journalistic talent to Cambridge--recent fellows of the program include David Skok, who now oversees the Globe's digital properties. Since Lipinski arrived three years ago, fellowship applications have more than doubled, and she's introduced two new tracks that are bringing together academics, digital journalists, and website coders to ponder the media's future.
we must disrupt
Clayton Christensen
Professor, Harvard Business School
In 1997Iattended my five-year reunion at HBS and will forever remember listening to Peter Drucker tell the assembled alums,"Don't take four-year college for granted."Ididn't really understand what he meant back then, nor didIhear many others talk inasimilar manner for many years. That is, until Clay Christensen began writing about the same subject in such powerful ways.
Clay's work on disruptive innovation has provided deeply important frameworks to help us better understand the future evolution of education. His ideas have powerful repercussions and predict one of the most significant changes that we will witness in our lives--the disruption and dismantling of higher education.
Clay tells us what we may not want to either hear or recognize: The way we educate our citizens is about to change in profound ways. Asasocial entrepreneur focused on education, his ideas are constantly informing and prodding us as we plan our future strategy. We would be unwise not to listen carefully to what he has to say. --Gerald Chertavian, Founder and CEO, Year Up
Ending Gender Inequality
Victoria Budson Executive Director, Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government
Every year,agroup of women emerge from Budson's Harvard Square to the Oval Office project ready to take over the American political system. But that's onlyafraction of what Budson is doing at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government: While talking heads debate work-life balance, pay equity, and leaning in, Budson's research-driven training programs help women navigate the political and economic landscape toward their own definition of success--all while teaching them to improve the lives of others in the process. Budson's expertise is routinely sought at the State Department, the White House, and by Governor Deval Patrick, and she was just named one of CNN's10Visionary Women. When Budson demands that those in power pay attention to women, they listen.
Googling the Genome 
David Altshuler
Director, the Broad Institute's Program in Medical and Population Genetics
Altshuler believes we're living in another Age of Discovery--but instead of surveying new continents, scientists the world over are mapping the genes of individual human beings. All that data becomes meaningful, however, only when it's shared and analyzed en masse. So Altshuler,agenomicist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, became one of the prime movers behind the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. When the alliance met for the first time this March, it was made up of more than200experts seekingapractical way to share their data.Anew partnership with Google will help them with that endeavor. If it succeeds, the alliance could openadoor to individual genetic medicine--personalized cancer treatments, for example--and createasimpler way for scientists to solve humanity's toughest health problems. As Altshuler says, it's"a very important moment in history."
Gun Disease
Vivek Murthy
Physician, Harvard Medical School Professor, and Surgeon General Nominee
Asadoctor, Murthy has hadalot of good ideas. He started an AIDS education nonprofit while still in med school, and later launchedacommunity-­health program in rural India. More recently he cofounded Trial­Networks--think Google Docs for pharmaceutical research--and Doctors for America, an advocacy group for affordable healthcare. But he may go down in history for the tweet that tied up his appointment to surgeon general:"Guns areahealth care issue." It's hardly an extremist position, yet the ensuing political maelstrom only served to spotlight that idea, and to reframe one of the most polarizing debates in the country today asapublic-health issue rather than merelyapolitical one. Strong medicine, indeed.
Justanudge
Cass Sunstein
Harvard Law School Professor, Author of Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness
When governments impose paternalistic new policies,asquall of opposition typically follows (see: the Affordable Care Act). And while Sunstein's stint as the White House chief of federal regulation wasn'tacomplete home run, his behavioral-science-based approach to policymaking has been embraced across the pond. Since 2010, British Prime Minister David Cameron's"nudge unit" has been using subtle tools to indoctrinate citizens on the wisdom of paying taxes on time, insulating their attics, and deciding to donate their organs. Small suggestions and smart thinking are cutting costs and having an impact elsewhere: One wonders when we'll finally get the hint. 
Basketball isagame of numbers 
 Mike Zarren 
Celtics Stats Guru
Zarren is responsible for the year's most game-changing proposal in sports: eliminate the NBA draft lottery in favor ofafixed wheel system that evenly distributes top picks to teams overaseries of years--therefore removing the incentive for teams at the bottom, like the Celtics, to lose in order to improve their lottery odds. That's just the latest of Zarren's ideas. As one of the pioneers of the NBA analytics movement, the Celtics' hyper-secretive stats guru has hadastealthy influence on the team foradecade. Lately, though, the 38-year-old Harvard Law grad has been much more open in discussing his fixed wheel proposal--it was the talk of the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference this year. But don't worry, Celtics fans: Zarren's system, however popular, cannot be implemented before this year's draft.
Viral peacemaking
 Farah Pandith 
Harvard Institute of Politics Fellow
"The best way to disrupt the ideology of extremists," Pandith has said,"is to provideacounter-narrative." Pandith was born in Kashmir to Muslim parents and raised in Milton and Braintree. Her job--for four years as the State Department's first-ever special representative to the Muslim community, appointed by Hillary Clinton, and now at Harvard--is to fight for the hearts and minds of the62percent of the world's Muslims who are under the age of 30, and struggling to define their identities inapost-9/11 world.
We Need to Talk about Your Smartphone
Sherry Turkle MIT Professor
When was the last time you paused to consider your relationship with your smartphone? MIT professor Sherry Turkle, the founder of the school's Initiative on Technology and Self, is an expert on the interactions between humans and ­machines. (She loved the film Her:"It really captured our vulnerability toadevice that seems to understand us," she says.) As the author of Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other, Turkle has explored what our devices are doing to human interaction and conversation (hint: it's not pretty)."We're so intent on documenting our life, that we sometimes don't take time to live our life," she says. So think about this the next time you postaselfie.
Dept. of Acquisitions
In the past few months, Google, Twitter, and Spotify snapped up local outfits Boston Dynamics, Bluefin Labs, and Echo Nest, respectively. Here are the brains behind the buyouts.
Marc Raibert, Boston Dynamics 
Acquired by Google for an undisclosed sum
The selling point The Waltham-based robotics firm is the juggernaut behind terrifying beast machines that, in YouTube videos, can be seen running at30miles per hour over mixed terrain like headless mechanical wolves. 
What's nextArobot apocalypse would be the obvious scenario, though nobody really knows. Raibert has always demurred on whether he's creatingaleague of mechanical overlords. Good thing Google's motto is"Don't Be Evil."
Deb Roy, Bluefin Labs
Acquired by Twitter for $90 million
The selling point Roy drew on his research in child-language acquisition at MIT's Media Lab to teach computers how to"read" social-media chatter about television, making it possible to measureamass audience reaction in real time. 
What's next Twitter presumably will use the Bluefin technology inamulti-year partnership with Nielsen to create next-generation TV ratings.
Brian Whitman and Tristan Jehan, Echo Nest
Acquired by Spotify forareported $100 million
The selling point The Somerville music-analysis outfit was quietly powering Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody, and other Internet music companies using its massive processing power to analyze35million songs--and what people are saying about those songs. 
What's next With all that data, Echo Nest's algorithms can now help Spotify spit out your perfect mix tape.
Rethinking Arts Education
Lee Pelton President, Emerson College
Inatown where there's no shortage of exceptional educational leadership, Pelton makes no small plans. In the past year alone, he unveiled Emerson's stunning new $85 million dollar campus in L.A. (the first of its kind for any East Coast school), kicked off an accelerator program (a rarity at an arts college), and launched the dynamic new Elma Lewis Center for Civic Engagement asahub to engage students in addressing the city's shortcomings. Perhaps most impressively, he sparkedanational discussion on how universities can deal with gun violence and created the College Presidents' Gun Violence Resource Center."We want big ideas that inspire people to do good things," he says.
immigration Innovation
Jeffrey Bussgang 
Flybridge Capital Partners
Bussgang'sadata junkie. When the venture capitalist looked at specs of the state's startup landscape, one stat stood out: Immigrants are powering Boston's innovation economy. Instead of taking jobs, they're making them, he argues, and by not enacting immigration reform, we're doingadisservice to our country. Over the past year, he's been working to createapublic-private partnership to enable foreign entrepreneurs in Boston to get an exemption from restrictive visa caps. This April, Governor Patrick announcedapilot program to test the concept.
AN OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Steve Conine and Niraj Shah 
Wayfair
WhileIam in awe of what cofounders Niraj Shah (CEO) and Steve Conine (co-chairman and CTO) have built inashort time,Ibelieve it is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2002, they had the vision, ambition, and determination to establish Wayfair asacompany that creates and acquires and builds, rather than sells out--andIbelieve that what they created will serve asamagnet for the best and the brightest talent. Since its launch, Wayfair has quietly grown into an almost $1 billion online furniture empire, employing more than 1,500 people in Boston. It will inevitably become one of the most significant Boston-based IPOs of recent times, and will bealeading force in making e-commerceamajor economic growth engine for our region.
--Joe Grimaldi, chairman, Mullen Advertising
Caregivers on demand
Sheila Lirio Marcelo
Care.com
You have an unexpected business dinner and you needareliable sitter who can wrangle your brood into bed before the clock strikes 8. For the 5.3 million families who use Care.com, which offers 24/7 access to the profiles of 4.5 million caregivers, this is no problem. Harvard alum Sheila Lirio Marcelo founded the Waltham company in 2006, raising $111 million in venture funding. Since then, she's turned Care.com into suchasuccess that when it released its IPO this past January, shares of the company rose nearly43percent in its first day of trading.
StartaDIY fitness revolution
Brogan Graham and Bojan Mandaric
The November Project
The November Project's manic, motivational, and mildly cultish mayhem, led by the charismatic duo Brogan Graham (left) and Bojan Mandaric, is bigger than you realize. The grassroots fitness movement is waging war on gym memberships by offering free early-morning workouts to hordes of fitness junkies three timesaweek. And now their concept--regular hill workouts, Harvard stadium runs, and random calisthenics challenges--has morphed intoasprawling international fitness community in15cities. The November Project's infectious camaraderie (expressed throughadisarming number of hugs) is all rooted inasingle, three-point mantra: Fitness should be fun, it's better withateam, and all you need to do is show up. 
Accelerating talent
Katie Rae and John Harthorne
Techstars and MassChallenge
Few people embody Boston's startup ecosystem better than Rae and Harthorne. Insanely connected, Rae has ushered dozens of promising businesses through the grueling Techstars program during her tenure as managing director. And Harthorne understands the impact one good idea can have on another: He picked the brains of more than 2,000 Bostonians before launching MassChallenge in 2008, and today the program is booming, with 1,600 pitches from41states and50countries in its latest application round. Now he's taking the concept global.
Boston beats Silicon Valley
Rich Miner and Bijan Siabet
Google Ventures and Spark Capital
This pair of entrepreneurs turned VC wunderkinds have proven track records when it comes to investing in the right tech companies at the right times. Since creating the Android platform, Miner's focus has been snagging up-and-comers like Nextbit and Crittercism for Google's $1.2 billion venture arm. Siabet spearheaded Spark Capital's early investments in Twitter, Foursquare, and Tumblr, walking away with $1.6 billion in Twitter shares after its IPO last year. His biggest effort of late was getting the governor to agree to outlaw non-compete clauses in the commonwealth.
Icons and visionaries
All the world'sastage
Diane Paulus, American Repertory Theater
Fresh off her2013Tony win with Pippin for best director ofamusical, Paulus has once again asserted herself asatheatrical force. Under her leadership, the A.R.T. has becomeaspringboard to Broadway (three shows now playing on the Great White Way were first staged in Cambridge), and her sensational new productions, like this year's Witness Uganda, have brought audiences back to the theater atatime when just getting people to show up is half the battle. Paulus's unique pedigree as bothaBroadway vet and Harvard academic has helped her stage musicals with mass appeal,apoint of contention among her avant-garde critics. Yet her vision is clear: The show must go on, and be spectacular in the process.
Leaders and idealists
Education starts with public service
Alan Solomont, Dean, Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service
Afterathree-year stint as U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra, Solomont (pictured) is tackling his next big challenge: higher education. The new dean of the Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts is leading the charge for the university's Tufts 1+4 program,agame-changing"bridge year" initiative through which accepted students complete one year of full-time service before beginning their undergrad education.Astaunch advocate for civic engagement, Solomont cut his teeth asacommunity organizer in Lowell in the 1970s. Solomont's mission is"to ensure everyone who gets an education at Tufts is educated to be an active citizen."
An anonymous internet is good for democracy 
Andrew Lewman, Tor Project
Despite revelations that the NSA tried to destabilize it, Tor--the world's best and most popular anonymous Web software and server network--is the tool most often used by dissidents and activists to evade repressive regimes in their home countries. It's so good at hiding who you are that criminals use it, too: The Silk Road, an online drug market busted by the feds last year, was reachable only by Tor users who had access to the so-called Dark Web that the rest of us can't even see. Despite that, Tor's largest funder has been....the federal government, to the tune of millions per year. Why? Because even the government that gave you worldwide surveillance still believes thataworld with an open Internet is freer than one in which the Web can be turned off atadictator's whim.
Restoring faith
Cardinal Séan O'Malley, Archdiocese of Boston
As the head of the Archdiocese of Boston, O'Malley is the spiritual leader for hundreds of thousands living in the region. AsaCardinal, he's one of the218most powerful men inaChurch of 1.2 billion. And as the lone American in Pope Francis's"G8" group working on Church government reform, he's now trying to solve the Church's deepest problems. In March, the pontiff named O'Malley one of three priests on the Vatican's new eight-person anti-abuse commission, largely due to his pattern-breaking, empathetic work with victims in Boston's sex-abuse scandal. Like Pope Francis, he's the embodiment ofaChurch onafulcrum: refreshingly humble, accessible, and progressive toward other religions, yet still representing its conservative ethos. 
Creatives drive the economy
Joyce Linehan, Chief of Policy, City of Boston
Linehan has one of the most powerful living rooms in all of progressive politics--hosting luminaries like Deval Patrick and Elizabeth Warren--andagreat deal of her influence came from her years asagrassroots organizer...of rock 'n' roll bands.Aformer punk-rock promoter from Dorchester, Linehan gradually found her power base in the city's creative class, from musicians to museum directors. In the city's first open mayoral race in two decades, she convinced her homeboy Marty Walsh that in Boston, the arts can be bothamajor engine of economic growth andapolitical constituency. Then she convinced artists that Walsh was on their side. Now that she's Walsh's director of policy, she's not only thinking about the arts inacity that's traditionally under-funded them--she's also inaposition to unleashaBoston renaissance.
Everything (microfunded) is awesome
Reed Sturtevant, Awesome Foundation 
Have an idea forapublic art project?Atech startup?Ameat-filled zebra piÃ±ata to entertain the lions at the zoo? If you can think of it, the Awesome Foundation will back it...as long as it's awesome enough. Sturtevant (pictured) cofounded the organization four years ago with nine"micro-trustees," and the group is today made up of90chapters across18countries (some as far flung as Doha, Qatar). How it works: Each chapter meets every month to vote on applicants, each member donates $100, and each winner receives $1,000 in cash. To date, the organization has funded935projects, foragrand total of $935,000. Now that's pretty awesome.
Outing liberalism
Carl Sciortino, Executive Director, AIDS Action Committee
Carl Sciortino may not have won last year's Congressional election to succeed Ed Markey, but he made the ­biggest splash with an ad featuring his Tea Partyâ "conservative dad. It went viral not just because it was clever, but because of Sciortino's unashamed defense of liberalism. Now,10years after entering politics to challenge an opponent of same-sex marriage, Sciortino has been picked to take over the AIDS Action Committee--and taken the moment to publicly disclose his HIV-positive status, again refusing to be ashamed of who he is.
Entrepreneurs and innovators
Reclaiming the original Innovation District 
Tim Rowe, Founder and CEO, Cambridge Innovation Center
Back in the 19th century, when Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were toiling over the light bulb and telephone, the two worked out of shared office space in the Financial District. Now, blocks away from where those inventors first brainstormed, Rowe foresees the new branch of the Cambridge Innovation Center reinvigorating downtown Boston, just as the original CIC helped launch the new Kendall Square. Rowe believes proximity among startups and innovators encourages collaboration, and is now bringing the concept to other major cities. First up: St. Louis, Missouri.
Bringing manufacturing back to Lawrence
Brenna Nan Schneider, 99Degrees Custom
By capitalizing on the burgeoning"me-commerce" industry, Schneider believes she's foundaway to bring manufacturing back to America. Working out ofabuilding in Lawrence's historical Everett Mills complex, her team cuts and sews custom-­designed retail goods for companies like West Elm, then ships the items directly to the consumer in two to five days. It's no coincidence that the business's home base is the site of the1912"Bread and Roses" labor strike: With 99Degrees Custom, Schneider hopes to buildarevolution of her own--an"up and out" employment model that will teach workers the skills they need to move into higher-paying manufacturing jobs. It'saconcept that's quite literally paid off: The company won the"diamond" award ($100,000) in2013in the MassChallenge competition.

Even in the first100days of the Walsh administration, there are signs that ideas matter. 
Better Together
 Marty Walsh Mayor, City of Boston
Leadingacity requires more than just power, and winning elections requires more than merely growing one's base. That's especially true here in Boston, where the traditional bases of political power are rapidly shifting, and change isagiven. Voters are smarter. Ideas matter to them. And even in the first100days, there are signs that ideas matter to the Walsh administration. That Boston is stronger when it looks outside its borders. Thatamodern city should stay open late and public transit should keep up. Thatapolice force, andagovernment, should reflect the city it serves.
To say that the mayor of Boston belongs on Boston magazine's power list is self-evident. The more interesting question--the fascinating idea at the heart of this issue--is how he got here in the first place. The idea was simple: To help yourself, help everyone else. Walsh began by helping his union brothers and sisters--asamember, an advocate, and thenaleader. Asastate rep, he helped his constituents within the enormous neighborhood of Dorchester, where about20percent of the city's residents reside. As someone who's been sober since 1995, he helped countless others in recovery, something he quietly continues to this day. Not surprisingly, these people became his groundswell--his army. 
When it was time for his own race for mayor, Walsh's army fought for their own. By that time, they realized it was their fight. Because power need not be hoarded by one; it can be harvested to empower many. --Mike Ross, former city councilor and mayoral candidate
Defending the Middle Class
Elizabeth Warren
Senator
"Today the game is rigged," Warren writes in her new memoir,AFighting Chance,"rigged to work for those who have money and power." The game of which she speaks, of course, is America. And inafew short years, Warren's ideas--that Wall Street banks and big corporations are screwing the middle class, and that Washington is little more thanalobbyist watering hole--have transformed progressive politics, not just in New England but around the country."Whether or not Elizabeth Warren ever runs for the presidency," The Nation opined recently,"she is teaching her partyagreat deal about how to take the events ofamoment and weave them intoanarrative."
Going to Bat for Journalism's Future 
John Henry
Owner, the Boston Globe
When Henry struckadeal to buy the Boston Globe last fall, it wasahome run for the long-suffering news business. With his checkbook, Henry made the point that great journalism is worth investing in. And from his newfound pulpit, he declared not only that journalism could be saved--but also that the Globe would become the laboratory driving its resurrection. How? Well, absentasilver-bullet solution, he's overhauled management to bring in big-thinking talent from both the advertising and media worlds, and embarked onastring of innovative products:anew, standalone Catholic news site,arebooted Boston.com, and the possibility ofaGlobe TV station. Who knows if those particular ideas will work, but one thing is certain: There will be more of them.
Boston's Global Future
John Fish Chairman and CEO, Suffolk 
Fish has hadaperennial place on our list. Let's face it: During the Menino mayoralty, he was the man to know. Now he's heading up Boston's2024Olympic bid, and rethinking the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce as its new chairman. We asked Boston's biggest builder why he's throwing his energy at these two projects. 
On Bringing the Olympics to Boston
"I start with the question: What is the city of Boston going to look like in30or40years? It involves thinking big--not just thinking about where we've been and where we're going, but thinkingalittle abnormally. We may never realize the Olympics in 2024, but the opportunity to bring the community together to talk about the future isapowerful thing."
On Rethinking the Chamber of Commerce
"We need to think about how we haveaconversation about regionalization--Idon't think it's helpful to takeaBoston-centric point of view. If we help out other communities in Massachusetts, and if those areas do well, Boston will be the beneficiary of their success. And that will enhance opportunities for all."
Seeing isn't believing
Errol Morris
Documentary Filmmaker
As an author, Morris has been obsessed with the notion that photographs often lie. His documentaries are obsessed with lies, too, like the Oscar-winning The Fog of War (2003), about Vietnam War architect Robert ­McNamara, and The Thin Blue Line (1988), which garnered the release ofaTexas inmate on death row. His latest, The Unknown Known, focuses on another icon of infallible self-truths: Donald Rumsfeld. Morris has an uncanny ability to probe and wait out his interviewees until they reveal surprising insights... or hang themselves. 
Venture Culturalism
Yo-Yo Ma
Cellist
The Cambridge-based classical-music superstar is one of the country's most eloquent voices on the idea that culture is essential forahealthy democracy."The arts," Ma told an audience at the Kennedy Center last April,"foster the four critical skills necessary for our children to succeed in the 21st-century workforce: collaboration, flexibility, imagination, innovation." 
Democratizing education
Anant Agarwal
CEO, edX
When edX launched in 2012, it floatedabig, bold, revolutionary concept: Give away Harvard and MIT's prestigious courses online, for free, to anyone in the world. Two years later, the concept of MOOCs--"massive open online courses"-- is transforming higher education, both inside and outside the classroom. Today, edX has more than130"blended" courses, in which teachers supplement in-class exercises with videos, virtual labs, and gamification. Agarwal sees future classrooms as interactive environments. And that future is not far off. 
Know your roots 
Henry Louis Gates
Harvard Professor
A pioneer in the field of African- American studies, Gates has long been one of the nation's preeminent thinkers about the nexus of ancestry and culture. His influence spans mediums--he wasaconsultant on12YearsaSlave, isacofounder of the online magazine the Root, and hostsaPBS series on genealogy.Adonor's recent $15 million gift to consolidate Harvard's African and African-American studies programs only expands his reach. If there'sacentral tenet to all of Gates's work, it's this: To understand yourself, you need to know where you came from. 
History Matters
Doris Kearns Goodwin and Jill Lepore
Historians
If anyone in Boston is making the case that academic ideas matter in the real world, it's historians Kearns Goodwin (pictured) and Lepore, who are to historical scholarship what Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis were to jazz: two very different kinds of genius whose shared art form has become crucial to the culture at large. Back in 2008, Senator Barack Obama devoured Kearns Goodwin's presidential biographies--especially her book on Lincoln, Team of Rivals--which many say influenced his choice to ­appoint Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Meanwhile, Lepore writes onawider variety of subjects, from King Philip's War to the modern Tea Party movement, but it's clear she takes her role just as seriously."To beapublic historian," she wrote recently,"is to beakeeper of our memory asapeople." Between the two of them, it seems like we're in good hands.
The web's next25Years 
Tim Berners-Lee, Larry Lessig, and Nicholas Negroponte
It's easy to forget that the Web, as we know it, was born here. This past March, MIT professor Tim Berners-Lee marked the 25th anniversary of his groundbreaking invention--and he continues to beavocal, thoughtful arbiter of its future, having recently proposed an online Magna Carta to encode values to the Web. Harvard Law professor Larry Lessig's career is grounded in his role as an Internet crusader. He revolutionized intellectual property and copyright law, advocated for net neutrality, and has now set his sights on the corrosive influence of money in politics. Nicholas Negroponte is looking forward: The MIT Media Lab and One Laptop Per Child founder has plans to use stationary satellites to expand Web access to"the last billion" people without the Internet.
Making Healthcare Accessible to All
Joseph Betancourt 
Director, the Disparities Solutions Center at Mass General
Betancourt realized early in his career that all the medical advances in the world mean nothing when racial and ethnic inequality plagues our healthcare system. So in 2004, Betancourt petitioned Massachusetts General Hospital to create the Disparities Solutions Center, which then launched the following year to address the barriers that were keeping his patients from getting adequate care. Since then, he's persuaded MGH to installa"disparities dashboard," which tracks how the hospital treats patients of varied cultural backgrounds. Betancourt also teaches cross-cultural medicine at Harvard Medical School, heads the department of multicultural education at MGH, and cofounded Quality Interactions, an e-learning company that, so far, has trained more than 130,000 physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other stakeholders. He's leading the healthcare industry in creating cross-cultural competence.--Marcela Garcia
Curing The rare diseases that Big Pharma won't
Mark Levin, Kevin Starr, and Bob Tepper 
Third Rock Ventures
This Boston-based venture firm doesn't just fund biotech and medical innovation, it creates it--finding the world's top scientific talent and building companies around their ideas. Since launching in 2007, it has raised $1.3 billion and helped create31companies that are now working on life-changing cures for ALS, cancer, and various orphan diseases. In the process, it's energizing the city's biotech pipeline.
Buildingabetter principal
Carolyn and Peter Lynch 
The Lynch Foundation
Fixing Boston's public school system has becomeafixation for the Lynches, who donated $2.5 million last year to help createanew leadership model. The Aspiring Principal Program isaresidency that will partner outstanding classroom teachers with successful principals for intense on-site training. Together they're buildinganew educational infrastructure.
Determining the future of American Energy
Ernest Moniz
U.S. Secretary of Energy 
I first met Ernie10years ago when we were onaNational Academy of Sciences panel discussing the transportation of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain, andIlast saw him at Cardullo's, in Harvard Square, where he tried to convince me that fracking wasa"proven" technology that mitigates climate change. He'saFall River native, MIT professor, and nuclear physicist with an unfaltering faith that technology will deliveraclean-energy future. Serving as the U.S. secretary of energy since May 2013, he's beenakeen proponent of both fracking and nuclear power, but critics point out his close ties with the oil and gas industries, particularly in relation to their funding of the MIT Energy Initiative. As such, he's been dubbed"the man in the middle," having to balance the Obama administration's increasingly strong stance on climate change with the needs ofastrident energy industry. In truth, Ernie's positions on the environment matter to us all.--Julian Agyeman, professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning, Tufts
Crowd sourcing disaster relief
Caitria and Morgan O'Neill 
Recovers
In 2011, armed with little more than liberal arts degrees and empathy, the O'Neill sisters responded toatornado in their hometown of Monson, Massachusetts, by spearheading donation and volunteer coordination out ofalocal church. The experience inspired them to create Recovers,awebsite where people can find instant updates, track local volunteer hours, and manage spontaneous donations. Since its2012launch, the"Twister Sisters" have helped28disaster-relief efforts and proved critical during Hurricane Sandy, enabling four New York City neighborhoods to coordinate 20,000 volunteers and donors.
Electing Women to higher office
Barbara Lee
Barbara Lee Foundation
If America electsawoman to be its next president, she'll have Lee to thank. Since 1999, Lee's foundation has been obsessed with training the next generation of female leaders to enter elective politics. You may have heard of some of her protégées--Elizabeth Warren, Wendy Davis, Martha Coakley. Lee has always been focused on building the long-term ladder to the political peak, and that work has kept growing. Vermont just became the 14th state withachapter of Lee's Emerge America, which trains women to enter elective politics.
Challenging Our Thinking on Disability and Design
 Sara Hendren
Artist, the Accessible Icon Project
When Hendren looked at the ubiquitous wheelchair symbol, designed in the late 1960s, she sawastatic, passive figure seemingly trapped in its chair. So in 2011, the Cambridge artist and writer, along with collaborator Brian Glenney, started placing translucent stickers that depictedaperson in motion--arms back, head and upper body thrust forward--over existing handicap signs. Their guerilla art efforts developed into the Accessible Icon Project, and has since been adopted by the Bronx Zoo, the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the University of Arizona, and inducted into the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. Hendren says the graphic sparks conversations:"It'saprovocation-- an invitation to think, 'What are my preconceived notions about people with disabilities?'" 
Groundbreaking Spacemaking
Tim Love Founder, Utile Architecture + Planning
The president-elect of the Boston Society of Architects has set his sights on revamping the entire design industry. Instead of waiting for commissions, Love is actively imagining what Boston should look like--and developing public-private partnerships to bring innovative urban ideas to fruition. It'saradical shift away from how development has been done in Boston for the past20years...but it's working. From rethinking Chinatown's development approach to finding creative ways to save Fort Point's historical buildings, Love's architectural ambitions know no bounds. Next on his agenda? Redesigning City Hall Plaza.
Collaborative Care
Betsy Nabel 
President, Brigham and Women's Hospital
You'll never find Nabel on an elevator; the cardiologist wasaresident at the Brigham long before she became its president, and her heart-healthy habit is to always take the stairs. Today, Nabel's taking steps to shape how the academic hospital will look and function by overseeing the design of the Brigham Building for the Future. In the planned 11-story, LEED Goldâ "certified structure, clinical research and patient care will occur side by side, fostering what Nabel calls"collisions of collaborations." Having researchers, clinicians, and educators in close proximity will not only allow the hospital to better use its resources, she argues, it will also transform healthcare."The future of medicine starts here," she says.
The Tedx Effect
TEDxBoston curator Danielle Duplin has been spotting trends in business and technology since the local spinoff of the speaking series first launched in 2009. Here, she recalls five of her favorite ideas from the past five years.
Lab onaStamp
Harvard chemist George Whitesides's medical diagnostics lab is the size ofapostage stamp and can cheaply and effectively detect common ailments for people in resource-limited settings.
Open-Source Drug Development 
Cancer researcher Jay Bradner"gave away" the formula for his JQ1 molecule that reprograms cancer cells in hopes that an open-source drug discovery model will get treatments to market faster than the current pharma methods.
NeoNurture Infant Incubator
Timothy Prestero, the CEO of Design That Matters, repurposed discarded car parts to build an infant incubator for people in the developing world. His award-winning invention has treated more than 1,000 babies in Vietnam, Myanmar, and Ghana.
Urban housing
The brilliantly imagined responsive homes and folding cars from MIT's Kent Larson will be able to fit more people comfortably into ever-growing urban areas--a wonderful application of technology in the service of humanity.
Organs on Chips
By demonstrating how drug testing on human organs can be simulated on microchips, Harvard scientist Geraldine Hamilton explores the not-too-distant future of personalized medicine and drug research.
Equality Starts Here
Ayanna Pressley City Councilor at Large
"Every morning,Ipray, drink coffee, put on red stilettos, and head out to change the world." That's Pressley's unique approach to getting things done. Everyone wanted her to run for something this past year--mayor, statewide office, even federal office. Instead she's intent on tackling some of Boston's toughest issues: improving the lives of women in the city; overhauling sex education in schools; and fighting the root causes of economic disparity, from liquor-license reform to discriminatory hiring practices. Pressley also launched the Elevate Boston coalition to encourage mayoral candidates to focus on women's and LGBT issues. No matter where she goes next, her powerful social-justice agenda will follow.
Go-big-or- go-home diplomacy
John Kerry
U.S. Secretary of State
Speaking of the Middle East peace talks, an anonymous Western official told Haaretz last May,"Sometimes there'safeeling that Kerry thinks the only reason his predecessors in the job didn't bring aboutapeace agreement is that they weren't John Kerry." Some would argue it's precisely that idealism that's been missing from American foreign policy."I may fail.Idon't care. It's worth doing," Kerry has said of the talks. No matter how intractable the situation or belligerent the players, Kerry bounds onto the scene believing he can negotiateasolution. And now, unburdened by the pursuit of higher office, he's free to set his own course.
Creating the next generation of peacemakers
Eric Dawson
President and Cofounder, Peace First
It's tempting to shield children from the world's harshest realities, but Dawson sees the innocence of youth as an opportunity to foster positive change. Over the past13years, Dawson has transformed Peace First intoanational institution that teaches and supports peacemaking skills. At last year's Clinton Global Initiative, it launched the Peace First Prize--a $25,000 annual award given to five to10kids, ages eight to 22, for their grassroots initiatives to prevent bullying, stop gun violence, and fight injustice. Through the prize, Peace First aims to create the next generation of thought leaders. 
Smart Growth
John Barros
Chief of Economic Development, City of Boston
After showing off his deep policy knowledge in an underdog campaign for mayor, Barros has becomeahousehold name in Boston. But his wide-ranging expertise, from housing to education to public safety, is nothing new to City Hall insiders. Now, tapped by Mayor Marty Walsh to head the city's economic development, Barros will get to apply his progressive but pragmatic approach to every corner of the city."I would argue he probably has the most powerful economic position in the city of Boston right now to makeadifference going forward," says John Fish.
The City as Urban Laboratory
Joe Curtatone 
Mayor of Somerville
Since taking office in 2004, Curtatone has been at the vanguard of municipal governance. He fixedacrippling budget deficit usingahomegrown data analytics tool, SomerStat, and overhauled the city's constituent services center. Somerville's economy is booming, and Curtatone is campaigning for more growth--from Legoland in Assembly Square to the long-delayed Green Line extension. It seems his penchant for adopting new ideas is paying off: Curtatone was just named an Ash Fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School to help teach others how it's done.
Championing Boston's Creative Class
Greg Selkoe and Malia Lazu
Future Boston 
Selkoe, founder of the online streetwear empire Karmaloop andaformer BRA staffer, often tangled with Mayor Menino. Boston, Selkoe argued, just wasn't fun enough. Frivolous? Not really. Future Boston, the nonprofit he runs with activist Malia Lazu, has been responsible for turning"fun" intoacampaign issue­ and pushing to make the cityaplace where young professionals can thrive.
Museums Must Support Themselves
Dan Monroe
Director and CEO, Peabody Essex Museum
Even without Malcolm Rogers's impending retirement from the MFA, Dan Monroe would be the lead candidate for the region's most dynamic museum director. Since taking the helm of the Peabody Essex in 1993, Monroe has overhauled the model for museum stewardship--knowing it's no longer enough to rely on gift-shop sales and annual contributions to keep an institution afloat. He's increased the museum's budget from $3.4 million to $24 million and aims to grow its endowment to $630 million--ensuring that the PEM's funding sources will remain solvent if the whims of the market (or less-­engaged young patrons) affect the bottom line. The PEM's forthcoming $650 million renovation will push the institution into the top10museums in the country in terms of gallery space, and Monroe's dream team of curatorial talent will undoubtably use it, as they continue to bring groundbreaking exhibits to Salem year after year.
Empowered and Engaged Mothers Are the Key to Ending Violence
Monalisa Smith and Kim Odom President, Mothers for Justice and Equity; Pastor and Peace Activist 
They are known simply as"The Mothers"--the survivors left standing after their children were taken from them by Boston's plague of urban violence--and inafew short years they have createdapower base out of powerlessness. Together, Smith (left) and Odom have reshaped the way Boston responds to trauma, using strategies that are"grounded," as they've written,"in the principles of restorative justice, an approach promoting the belief that healing through social connectivity and engagement will prevent street violence and lead to healthier, more vibrant communities." The mothers have built, from their grief,agrassroots movement that seeks to hold the rest of the city accountable whenalife is lost--and attempts to make the city whole again.
MAKE big plans
Deval Patrick
Governor
For proof of Patrick's impact on American politics, look no further than the White House: Many of the ideas that led to Obama's election were on display during Patrick's2006campaign. In his eight years in office, he's governed by championing big plans like expanding healthcare, attackingadecades-long transportation crisis, and pushing for the development of our technology, life-science, and clean-energy sectors, which not only helped generate jobs but also kept us at the forefront of the nation's economic recovery. Beacon Hill insiders have long whispered that Patrick just doesn't get their politics, while true believers and cynics alike have speculated that his future was too bright for him to stick around. And yet he has. He's the only multiterm governor to serve the state without seeking higher office in almost150years, and along the way, he has made an impact that will be felt for years to come. But I'd argue that his power isn't in what he's done as much as in how he's done it. He has made us believe once again that service and big ideas haveaplace in political life, and in so doing inspiredageneration of grassroots activists, first-time candidates, and everyday idealists to takeachance onacouple of big ideas of our own. --Liz Morningstar, CEO, Boston Public Market 
Food For Thought
Six local ideas that are changing how we eat.
The growers
Jon Friedman and Brad McNamara
President and CEO, Freight Farms
The idea. Making new space to grow food--anywhere.
It's now possible to cultivateabounty of fresh, local produce miles from the nearest farm--if you have access toa"Leafy Green Machine." Designed by Friedman and McNamara from"upcycled" shipping containers, Freight Farms come ready-made with high-tech hydroponic equipment suitable for growing leafy veggies and herbs like basil, arugula, and kale in any climate. Freight Farms may have started locally, but its mobile units are now cropping up everywhere from San Antonio, Texas, to Edina, Minnesota.
Courtney Hennessy and John Stoddard
Cofounders, Higher Ground Farm
the IDEA Bringing urban farming to new heights.
The merits of rooftop gardening are obvious: optimal sun exposure for produce, reduced cooling and insulation costs for the building, easy access to quality product. Now imagine those effects onahuge scale--the Boston Design Center's 55,000-square-foot roof. Since debuting last spring, Higher Ground's output has landed on the menus of high-profile local restaurants like Neptune Oyster, Tavern Road, and Tres Gatos. 
The producers
Darnell Adams, Brad Stevens, and Roz Freeman
Managing Director, Executive Chef, and Operations Manager, CropCircle Kitchen
The idea. Letting small food businesses think big.
Since 2009, CropCircle Kitchen has launched startups by providing shared cooking and storage space in Jamaica Plain. The demand has been so great that this spring the team will openanew 36,000-square-foot facility in Dorchester. To learn more about the enormous undertaking, turn to page 104.
Michael Leviton
Chef, Lumière, Area Four, and A4 Pizza Bar
The idea. Sustainability, one dish atatime.
Terms like"local,""sustainable," and"seasonal" areaway of life for Leviton (pictured). As the chair of the board of Chefs Collaborative,anational coalition of sustainability-minded tastemakers, he helps chefs around the country make positive changes in their restaurants, from sourcing antibiotic-free meat to choosing less-heavily-fished seafood selections.
The servers
Ashley Stanley 
Founder and CEO, Lovin' Spoonfuls
The idea. Getting excess food to the hungry. 
Stanley started her food-rescue nonprofit Lovin' Spoonfuls in2010withasingle insulated truck. Four years later, she's now up toafleet of four, and is on track to rescue one million pounds of excess food in 2014. The trucks travel throughout Greater Boston picking up overstock at large-shelf grocers and farms, then redistribute it to organizations like Rosie's Place and the Pine Street Inn. Now Stanley has plans to expand throughout the state, and eventually across the country.
Doug Rauch
Founder and CEO, the Daily Table
The idea.Arestaurant serving expired food.
Here'sadirty little secret: Food that's past its sell-by date isn't necessarily spoiled. In fact, with the Daily Table, former Trader Joe's CEO Doug Rauch has decided to sell wholesome, nutrient-rich, ready-made meals made with food that's past its prime. This summer he'll opena9,000-square-foot takeout restaurant meets grocery store in Dorchester, utilizing past-sell-date food and excess product from farms and large-scale retailers to help keep costs down.Arecent Harvard study gave the practiceathumbs-up. Waste not, want not. 
Play to win
Michael Porter 
Professor, Harvard Business School
Porter may be among the most preeminent business professors on the planet--he's the mastermind behind the concept of competitive advantage--but the power of his ideas reaches way beyond Wall Street. Healthcare reformers are currently using his methods to reframe how they deliver care, and nations use his Social Progress Index to measure the well-being of their citizens. Considering that our own country ranked 16th on his index, Porter, through his U.S. Competitive Project at Harvard, is now bringing together thought leaders to strategize on how to keep America at the front of an increasingly global, industrialized, and, yes, competitive economy.
Be An Anti-Disciplinarian
Joi Ito
Director, MIT's Media Lab
Ito runs MIT's Media Lab, the city's foremost Râ  &â  D think tank and the nexus of business, science, and innovation in Boston. He's alsoarave DJ who swims with sharks. But Ito's real talent is making connections. As head of the lab, his policy for faculty members is that they be"anti-disciplinary.""To me," he told Wired magazine,"there'sascience to community building." In practice, the community Ito has built is turning out such sci-fi marvels as printable genes, snap-together electronic components, and wristbands that measure emotions. Their work pulls in the city's best raw materials--capital, brainpower, technology--that drive so many of our best ideas into its orbit.
Media Matters
Ann Marie Lipinski Curator, Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
As The First female curator of Harvard's Nieman Foundation, the Pulitzer Prizeâ "winning writer and editor is drawing the world's top journalistic talent to Cambridge--recent fellows of the program include David Skok, who now oversees the Globe's digital properties. Since Lipinski arrived three years ago, fellowship applications have more than doubled, and she's introduced two new tracks that are bringing together academics, digital journalists, and website coders to ponder the media's future.
we must disrupt
Clayton Christensen
Professor, Harvard Business School
In 1997Iattended my five-year reunion at HBS and will forever remember listening to Peter Drucker tell the assembled alums,"Don't take four-year college for granted."Ididn't really understand what he meant back then, nor didIhear many others talk inasimilar manner for many years. That is, until Clay Christensen began writing about the same subject in such powerful ways.
Clay's work on disruptive innovation has provided deeply important frameworks to help us better understand the future evolution of education. His ideas have powerful repercussions and predict one of the most significant changes that we will witness in our lives--the disruption and dismantling of higher education.
Clay tells us what we may not want to either hear or recognize: The way we educate our citizens is about to change in profound ways. Asasocial entrepreneur focused on education, his ideas are constantly informing and prodding us as we plan our future strategy. We would be unwise not to listen carefully to what he has to say. --Gerald Chertavian, Founder and CEO, Year Up
Ending Gender Inequality
Victoria Budson Executive Director, Women and Public Policy Program at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government
Every year,agroup of women emerge from Budson's Harvard Square to the Oval Office project ready to take over the American political system. But that's onlyafraction of what Budson is doing at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government: While talking heads debate work-life balance, pay equity, and leaning in, Budson's research-driven training programs help women navigate the political and economic landscape toward their own definition of success--all while teaching them to improve the lives of others in the process. Budson's expertise is routinely sought at the State Department, the White House, and by Governor Deval Patrick, and she was just named one of CNN's10Visionary Women. When Budson demands that those in power pay attention to women, they listen.
Googling the Genome 
David Altshuler
Director, the Broad Institute's Program in Medical and Population Genetics
Altshuler believes we're living in another Age of Discovery--but instead of surveying new continents, scientists the world over are mapping the genes of individual human beings. All that data becomes meaningful, however, only when it's shared and analyzed en masse. So Altshuler,agenomicist at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, became one of the prime movers behind the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. When the alliance met for the first time this March, it was made up of more than200experts seekingapractical way to share their data.Anew partnership with Google will help them with that endeavor. If it succeeds, the alliance could openadoor to individual genetic medicine--personalized cancer treatments, for example--and createasimpler way for scientists to solve humanity's toughest health problems. As Altshuler says, it's"a very important moment in history."
Gun Disease
Vivek Murthy
Physician, Harvard Medical School Professor, and Surgeon General Nominee
Asadoctor, Murthy has hadalot of good ideas. He started an AIDS education nonprofit while still in med school, and later launchedacommunity-­health program in rural India. More recently he cofounded Trial­Networks--think Google Docs for pharmaceutical research--and Doctors for America, an advocacy group for affordable healthcare. But he may go down in history for the tweet that tied up his appointment to surgeon general:"Guns areahealth care issue." It's hardly an extremist position, yet the ensuing political maelstrom only served to spotlight that idea, and to reframe one of the most polarizing debates in the country today asapublic-health issue rather than merelyapolitical one. Strong medicine, indeed.
Justanudge
Cass Sunstein
Harvard Law School Professor, Author of Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness
When governments impose paternalistic new policies,asquall of opposition typically follows (see: the Affordable Care Act). And while Sunstein's stint as the White House chief of federal regulation wasn'tacomplete home run, his behavioral-science-based approach to policymaking has been embraced across the pond. Since 2010, British Prime Minister David Cameron's"nudge unit" has been using subtle tools to indoctrinate citizens on the wisdom of paying taxes on time, insulating their attics, and deciding to donate their organs. Small suggestions and smart thinking are cutting costs and having an impact elsewhere: One wonders when we'll finally get the hint. 
Basketball isagame of numbers 
 Mike Zarren 
Celtics Stats Guru
Zarren is responsible for the year's most game-changing proposal in sports: eliminate the NBA draft lottery in favor ofafixed wheel system that evenly distributes top picks to teams overaseries of years--therefore removing the incentive for teams at the bottom, like the Celtics, to lose in order to improve their lottery odds. That's just the latest of Zarren's ideas. As one of the pioneers of the NBA analytics movement, the Celtics' hyper-secretive stats guru has hadastealthy influence on the team foradecade. Lately, though, the 38-year-old Harvard Law grad has been much more open in discussing his fixed wheel proposal--it was the talk of the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference this year. But don't worry, Celtics fans: Zarren's system, however popular, cannot be implemented before this year's draft.
Viral peacemaking
 Farah Pandith 
Harvard Institute of Politics Fellow
"The best way to disrupt the ideology of extremists," Pandith has said,"is to provideacounter-narrative." Pandith was born in Kashmir to Muslim parents and raised in Milton and Braintree. Her job--for four years as the State Department's first-ever special representative to the Muslim community, appointed by Hillary Clinton, and now at Harvard--is to fight for the hearts and minds of the62percent of the world's Muslims who are under the age of 30, and struggling to define their identities inapost-9/11 world.
We Need to Talk about Your Smartphone
Sherry Turkle MIT Professor
When was the last time you paused to consider your relationship with your smartphone? MIT professor Sherry Turkle, the founder of the school's Initiative on Technology and Self, is an expert on the interactions between humans and ­machines. (She loved the film Her:"It really captured our vulnerability toadevice that seems to understand us," she says.) As the author of Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other, Turkle has explored what our devices are doing to human interaction and conversation (hint: it's not pretty)."We're so intent on documenting our life, that we sometimes don't take time to live our life," she says. So think about this the next time you postaselfie.
Dept. of Acquisitions
In the past few months, Google, Twitter, and Spotify snapped up local outfits Boston Dynamics, Bluefin Labs, and Echo Nest, respectively. Here are the brains behind the buyouts.
Marc Raibert, Boston Dynamics 
Acquired by Google for an undisclosed sum
The selling point The Waltham-based robotics firm is the juggernaut behind terrifying beast machines that, in YouTube videos, can be seen running at30miles per hour over mixed terrain like headless mechanical wolves. 
What's nextArobot apocalypse would be the obvious scenario, though nobody really knows. Raibert has always demurred on whether he's creatingaleague of mechanical overlords. Good thing Google's motto is"Don't Be Evil."
Deb Roy, Bluefin Labs
Acquired by Twitter for $90 million
The selling point Roy drew on his research in child-language acquisition at MIT's Media Lab to teach computers how to"read" social-media chatter about television, making it possible to measureamass audience reaction in real time. 
What's next Twitter presumably will use the Bluefin technology inamulti-year partnership with Nielsen to create next-generation TV ratings.
Brian Whitman and Tristan Jehan, Echo Nest
Acquired by Spotify forareported $100 million
The selling point The Somerville music-analysis outfit was quietly powering Spotify, Rdio, Rhapsody, and other Internet music companies using its massive processing power to analyze35million songs--and what people are saying about those songs. 
What's next With all that data, Echo Nest's algorithms can now help Spotify spit out your perfect mix tape.
Rethinking Arts Education
Lee Pelton President, Emerson College
Inatown where there's no shortage of exceptional educational leadership, Pelton makes no small plans. In the past year alone, he unveiled Emerson's stunning new $85 million dollar campus in L.A. (the first of its kind for any East Coast school), kicked off an accelerator program (a rarity at an arts college), and launched the dynamic new Elma Lewis Center for Civic Engagement asahub to engage students in addressing the city's shortcomings. Perhaps most impressively, he sparkedanational discussion on how universities can deal with gun violence and created the College Presidents' Gun Violence Resource Center."We want big ideas that inspire people to do good things," he says.
immigration Innovation
Jeffrey Bussgang 
Flybridge Capital Partners
Bussgang'sadata junkie. When the venture capitalist looked at specs of the state's startup landscape, one stat stood out: Immigrants are powering Boston's innovation economy. Instead of taking jobs, they're making them, he argues, and by not enacting immigration reform, we're doingadisservice to our country. Over the past year, he's been working to createapublic-private partnership to enable foreign entrepreneurs in Boston to get an exemption from restrictive visa caps. This April, Governor Patrick announcedapilot program to test the concept.
AN OTTOMAN EMPIRE
Steve Conine and Niraj Shah 
Wayfair
WhileIam in awe of what cofounders Niraj Shah (CEO) and Steve Conine (co-chairman and CTO) have built inashort time,Ibelieve it is only the tip of the iceberg. In 2002, they had the vision, ambition, and determination to establish Wayfair asacompany that creates and acquires and builds, rather than sells out--andIbelieve that what they created will serve asamagnet for the best and the brightest talent. Since its launch, Wayfair has quietly grown into an almost $1 billion online furniture empire, employing more than 1,500 people in Boston. It will inevitably become one of the most significant Boston-based IPOs of recent times, and will bealeading force in making e-commerceamajor economic growth engine for our region.
--Joe Grimaldi, chairman, Mullen Advertising
Caregivers on demand
Sheila Lirio Marcelo
Care.com
You have an unexpected business dinner and you needareliable sitter who can wrangle your brood into bed before the clock strikes 8. For the 5.3 million families who use Care.com, which offers 24/7 access to the profiles of 4.5 million caregivers, this is no problem. Harvard alum Sheila Lirio Marcelo founded the Waltham company in 2006, raising $111 million in venture funding. Since then, she's turned Care.com into suchasuccess that when it released its IPO this past January, shares of the company rose nearly43percent in its first day of trading.
StartaDIY fitness revolution
Brogan Graham and Bojan Mandaric
The November Project
The November Project's manic, motivational, and mildly cultish mayhem, led by the charismatic duo Brogan Graham (left) and Bojan Mandaric, is bigger than you realize. The grassroots fitness movement is waging war on gym memberships by offering free early-morning workouts to hordes of fitness junkies three timesaweek. And now their concept--regular hill workouts, Harvard stadium runs, and random calisthenics challenges--has morphed intoasprawling international fitness community in15cities. The November Project's infectious camaraderie (expressed throughadisarming number of hugs) is all rooted inasingle, three-point mantra: Fitness should be fun, it's better withateam, and all you need to do is show up. 
Accelerating talent
Katie Rae and John Harthorne
Techstars and MassChallenge
Few people embody Boston's startup ecosystem better than Rae and Harthorne. Insanely connected, Rae has ushered dozens of promising businesses through the grueling Techstars program during her tenure as managing director. And Harthorne understands the impact one good idea can have on another: He picked the brains of more than 2,000 Bostonians before launching MassChallenge in 2008, and today the program is booming, with 1,600 pitches from41states and50countries in its latest application round. Now he's taking the concept global.
Boston beats Silicon Valley
Rich Miner and Bijan Siabet
Google Ventures and Spark Capital
This pair of entrepreneurs turned VC wunderkinds have proven track records when it comes to investing in the right tech companies at the right times. Since creating the Android platform, Miner's focus has been snagging up-and-comers like Nextbit and Crittercism for Google's $1.2 billion venture arm. Siabet spearheaded Spark Capital's early investments in Twitter, Foursquare, and Tumblr, walking away with $1.6 billion in Twitter shares after its IPO last year. His biggest effort of late was getting the governor to agree to outlaw non-compete clauses in the commonwealth.
Icons and visionaries
All the world'sastage
Diane Paulus, American Repertory Theater
Fresh off her2013Tony win with Pippin for best director ofamusical, Paulus has once again asserted herself asatheatrical force. Under her leadership, the A.R.T. has becomeaspringboard to Broadway (three shows now playing on the Great White Way were first staged in Cambridge), and her sensational new productions, like this year's Witness Uganda, have brought audiences back to the theater atatime when just getting people to show up is half the battle. Paulus's unique pedigree as bothaBroadway vet and Harvard academic has helped her stage musicals with mass appeal,apoint of contention among her avant-garde critics. Yet her vision is clear: The show must go on, and be spectacular in the process.
Leaders and idealists
Education starts with public service
Alan Solomont, Dean, Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service
Afterathree-year stint as U.S. ambassador to Spain and Andorra, Solomont (pictured) is tackling his next big challenge: higher education. The new dean of the Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts is leading the charge for the university's Tufts 1+4 program,agame-changing"bridge year" initiative through which accepted students complete one year of full-time service before beginning their undergrad education.Astaunch advocate for civic engagement, Solomont cut his teeth asacommunity organizer in Lowell in the 1970s. Solomont's mission is"to ensure everyone who gets an education at Tufts is educated to be an active citizen."
An anonymous internet is good for democracy 
Andrew Lewman, Tor Project
Despite revelations that the NSA tried to destabilize it, Tor--the world's best and most popular anonymous Web software and server network--is the tool most often used by dissidents and activists to evade repressive regimes in their home countries. It's so good at hiding who you are that criminals use it, too: The Silk Road, an online drug market busted by the feds last year, was reachable only by Tor users who had access to the so-called Dark Web that the rest of us can't even see. Despite that, Tor's largest funder has been....the federal government, to the tune of millions per year. Why? Because even the government that gave you worldwide surveillance still believes thataworld with an open Internet is freer than one in which the Web can be turned off atadictator's whim.
Restoring faith
Cardinal Séan O'Malley, Archdiocese of Boston
As the head of the Archdiocese of Boston, O'Malley is the spiritual leader for hundreds of thousands living in the region. AsaCardinal, he's one of the218most powerful men inaChurch of 1.2 billion. And as the lone American in Pope Francis's"G8" group working on Church government reform, he's now trying to solve the Church's deepest problems. In March, the pontiff named O'Malley one of three priests on the Vatican's new eight-person anti-abuse commission, largely due to his pattern-breaking, empathetic work with victims in Boston's sex-abuse scandal. Like Pope Francis, he's the embodiment ofaChurch onafulcrum: refreshingly humble, accessible, and progressive toward other religions, yet still representing its conservative ethos. 
Creatives drive the economy
Joyce Linehan, Chief of Policy, City of Boston
Linehan has one of the most powerful living rooms in all of progressive politics--hosting luminaries like Deval Patrick and Elizabeth Warren--andagreat deal of her influence came from her years asagrassroots organizer...of rock 'n' roll bands.Aformer punk-rock promoter from Dorchester, Linehan gradually found her power base in the city's creative class, from musicians to museum directors. In the city's first open mayoral race in two decades, she convinced her homeboy Marty Walsh that in Boston, the arts can be bothamajor engine of economic growth andapolitical constituency. Then she convinced artists that Walsh was on their side. Now that she's Walsh's director of policy, she's not only thinking about the arts inacity that's traditionally under-funded them--she's also inaposition to unleashaBoston renaissance.
Everything (microfunded) is awesome
Reed Sturtevant, Awesome Foundation 
Have an idea forapublic art project?Atech startup?Ameat-filled zebra piÃ±ata to entertain the lions at the zoo? If you can think of it, the Awesome Foundation will back it...as long as it's awesome enough. Sturtevant (pictured) cofounded the organization four years ago with nine"micro-trustees," and the group is today made up of90chapters across18countries (some as far flung as Doha, Qatar). How it works: Each chapter meets every month to vote on applicants, each member donates $100, and each winner receives $1,000 in cash. To date, the organization has funded935projects, foragrand total of $935,000. Now that's pretty awesome.
Outing liberalism
Carl Sciortino, Executive Director, AIDS Action Committee
Carl Sciortino may not have won last year's Congressional election to succeed Ed Markey, but he made the ­biggest splash with an ad featuring his Tea Partyâ "conservative dad. It went viral not just because it was clever, but because of Sciortino's unashamed defense of liberalism. Now,10years after entering politics to challenge an opponent of same-sex marriage, Sciortino has been picked to take over the AIDS Action Committee--and taken the moment to publicly disclose his HIV-positive status, again refusing to be ashamed of who he is.
Entrepreneurs and innovators
Reclaiming the original Innovation District 
Tim Rowe, Founder and CEO, Cambridge Innovation Center
Back in the 19th century, when Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were toiling over the light bulb and telephone, the two worked out of shared office space in the Financial District. Now, blocks away from where those inventors first brainstormed, Rowe foresees the new branch of the Cambridge Innovation Center reinvigorating downtown Boston, just as the original CIC helped launch the new Kendall Square. Rowe believes proximity among startups and innovators encourages collaboration, and is now bringing the concept to other major cities. First up: St. Louis, Missouri.
Bringing manufacturing back to Lawrence
Brenna Nan Schneider, 99Degrees Custom
By capitalizing on the burgeoning"me-commerce" industry, Schneider believes she's foundaway to bring manufacturing back to America. Working out ofabuilding in Lawrence's historical Everett Mills complex, her team cuts and sews custom-­designed retail goods for companies like West Elm, then ships the items directly to the consumer in two to five days. It's no coincidence that the business's home base is the site of the1912"Bread and Roses" labor strike: With 99Degrees Custom, Schneider hopes to buildarevolution of her own--an"up and out" employment model that will teach workers the skills they need to move into higher-paying manufacturing jobs. It'saconcept that's quite literally paid off: The company won the"diamond" award ($100,000) in2013in the MassChallenge competition.

FOR THE LOVE OF FALL
WE WAIT ALL YEAR FOR AUTUMN--ITS FIERY COLORS, ITS CRISP, COOL NIGHTS. HERE, SIX LOCALLY ROOTED WRITERS REVEAL WHAT THEY LOVE (AND DON'T LOVE) ABOUT NEW ENGLAND'S FAVORITE SEASON. PLUS, WE OFFER FIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR ENJOYING THE LAST WEEKENDS BEFORE THE WEATHER TURNS. EDITED BY KIM ATKINSON AND GREG LALAS/ (1)THE FALL OF MY MEMORY //
By CHRISTOPHER BUCKLEY
Christopher Buckley is a novelist and editor of Forbes FYI. His latest novel, No Way to Treat a First Lady, will be published this month.
AH, FALL, SEASON OF MISTS AND MELlow fruitfulness, as Keats put it before heading off to Rome to cough his life out in a pensione overlooking the Spanish Steps. According to the book I have, his "To Autumn" is the most popular poem in the English language. And here I thought "Casey at the Bat" had that distinction. Well, I'm not a bit surprised: Everyone's a sucker for fall. If you grew up in New England, as I did, this was when you knew you were in the Right Place.
That apple smell, those burning leaves. Those of you younger than I--an ever-growing cohort as I face 50 head-on--won't remember being able to burn those massive piles of leaves that your parents made you rake. The Environment Police put an end to that, on the grounds that that rich, musky smoke would plunge the world into another millennial winter. But while it lasted, it was a glorious smell those smoldering leaves made. I'm reminded of it on sunny days when my 10-year-old sets fire to a single leaf on the patio with a magnifying glass. Like Proust biting on the madeleine, I'm transported back 40 years. Now they don't even use rakes anymore. The delicate scritch-scratch of steely tines combing the grass has been supplanted by eardrum-busting backpack-turbine leaf blowers. The new generations will never know that tranquility or smell.
In fall, ripeness is all, as Lear said. Dr. Bell lived next door to us and had a vegetable garden, and by this time of year, the tomatoes would be red and heavy on their vines. We'd sneak in with salt shakers and gorge. We even ate his corn raw, each kernel exploding with sugar juice. My mother would serve acorn squash puddle with butter and brown sugar, probably the only sensible child delivery system for food called "squash." The pumpkins had a hollow thunk if you tapped them. Gutting them was never my favorite part, the way the innards clung to the sides. Back then the eyes, noses, and mouths came out quaintly geometrical. Now I buy those templates that make your pumpkin look like it was designed by the special-effects crew of Halloween Part V. What's remained constant is the smell of candle-scorched pumpkin and the delicious pagan feel of the ceremony.
People visiting from other parts of the country would say, "Aren't the trees beautiful." I'd shrug. The trees were exactly what they were supposed to be this time of year. What was so unusual about them?
We would drive to New Haven for the Yale-Harvard game. This was my inculcation into tribalism, when I first apprehended the natural hierarchy. Those usually sunny days with blue and crimson banners flying seem especially vivid now, as though I'm replaying them on DVD. I think we lost more often than we won, but this was reassuringly pointed to as proof of Harvard's intellectual superiority. During the final down of one close game, I remember my father telling me that it was sad because this moment would be the last time these players would be on a field. Looking back on it, it seems appropriate that my first intimation of mortality should have been imparted to me during the season of natural moribundity.
Thanksgivings we drove to northwestern Connecticut, to my grandmother's house. When we arrived, I would tumble out of the rattly diesel Mercedes and race into the house to make mischief with cousins. Since there were 49 of them, the opportunities were abundant. Later on, when I was older, the ritual became to shoot pheasant on Thanksgiving morning. Not much fun for the pheasant, I admit, but walking through those fields following the tinkle of the dogs' collar bells is one of my happiest memories. Of the Thanksgiving meals, my clearest memory is of the pearled onions in cream, mince pies, and bottles from my dead grandfather's celebrated wine cellar that were brought up and decanted. Some of these had been "maturing" since the First World War. Often, there would be half an inch of purple mud at the bottom of each glass. My aunts and uncles would ooh and aah over these pressings, but noticing a wince and pucker here and there, we at the junior tables had our suspicions.
Then it would be time to part, a wrenching occasion since a full year might pass before we saw each other again. These wistful rituals on the porch, in the early darkening of November afternoons, were, I now understand, rehearsals for the eventual, more final partings that fall presages.
BALLOONING
If you've seen foliage only from the ground, you've seen only half the leaves. It takes a bird's-eye view to appreciate the colors of fall. Hot-air ballooning offers just that. "When you float over the leaves, you are looking directly at their surface, and the color intensity is much greater," says Dick Young, of Vermont's A Beautiful Balloon.
Though October is one of the best ballooning months, at least 25 percent of flights are canceled due to bad weather. Be sure to reserve backup times in case your first choice falls flat.
A Beautiful Balloon offers sunrise and sunset flights over Vermont's Champlain Valley, departing from Rutland, Killington, Middlebury, and other areas. $ 225 per person. Call 973-335-9799 or visit www.balloon-rides.com. Balloon flights are also available from High 5 Ballooning, Derry, New Hampshire, 603-893-9643 or www.high5ballooning. com; Liberty Flights, Amherst, New Hampshire, 603-673-0070 or www.hotairballoon.org/liberty; Balloon Rides, Portland, Maine, 800-952-2076 or www.hotairballoon.com; and Balloons over New England, Kennebunk, Maine, 800-788-5562 or www.balloonsovernewengland.com. 
(2)LOVE AND HATE //
By SUSANNA KAYSEN
Susanna Kaysen is the author of Girl, Interrupted. She teaches at Boston University. I KNOW THAT IT'S CONSIDERED BEAUTIful. I've even considered it beautiful myself sometimes. I know that it brings in millions of leaf-peeping dollars to New England. I know for sure that it's better than the winter shortly to follow it (too cold) and the summer it's replacing (too hot). And, yet, I don't like fall.
It's cheap-looking. Those gaudy colors--as if the trees had come into a small inheritance and gone crazy in the jewelry department of Service Merchandise: Give me a cubic zirconium toe ring and ruby tennis bracelet and some yellow diamond earrings. There's nothing tasteful about a maple in October.
Fall can tart itself up with baubles and rouge and perfume itself with overripe crab apples and bee-nibbled pears, but it doesn't fool me. The whole world is dying and nothing can cover up the rot. There's a dank, moldy underwhiff to the breeze off the river. I'm Persephone and I'm going down and I hate it.
Partly, too, it's the association with school. Summer meant no shoes, no schedule. Aimless, I bobbed in the inflatable backyard pool when I was little, in the vast chill Atlantic as I got older. All those teenage romances pursued on my three-speed through humid Cambridge evenings still haunt me 30 years on. Give me a hot half-moon rising out of a polluted orange sunset at the end of July and I can taste 14 again. The yearning! To know, to be, to kiss, to Get out of the House.
And then September slams down the ax on summer's drowsy neck. Every year condemned to death. No reprieves. And every kid sent back to the prison of school where I was bored and fidgety and would not or could not learn anything.
Partly, of course, it's a perverse desire to disagree. Oh, the beauties of New England autumn, blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm not going along with that, anymore than I go along with Virginia Woolf is the greatest writer of the 20th century, or Let's all go the gym and become fit and fabulous. No, thanks.
But what is it, really?
I think it's that I can't bear the painstaking demonstrations of Time: the disintegrating, the falling off and down, the crumpling, the desiccation of what was juicy, the dismemberment of what was full, the leaching out of what was vibrant and lovely. This is what I will do to you, eventually, slowly, carefully, and without reprieve, as I do it every year to the vegetable world.
Unlike me, though, the vegetable world has a resurrection in store.
Maybe I hate fall because I'm not a believer. Eons ago, in a creative application of botanical facts to the human life cycle, mankind made one of the greatest inventions, from which have sprung art, music, and the moral sense: religion. It's not, however, based on data from clinical trials. But that doesn't stop many people from believing that they, too, will resume their life after their death. If I thought I was coming back bigger and better in April, I might not feel such keen resentment of October.
And now let me contradict everything I've just said.
What I love about fall in New England is the way it makes us all look mortality in the face. I think this is what appeals to everyone, though they may not frame it that way. The fall is as golden and red and pungent and snappy as the last time we saw it, and we are richer or poorer, in love or losing it, expectant or disappointed, but, definitely, no doubt about it, one year further along.
And haven't you thought, some years, when you stand in front of your apartment looking at the maple burning up the end of your street: How many more times will I see this magnificent funeral pyre?
AUTUMN WEEKENDS
ANTIQUING
Entire lifetimes have been spent sifting through New England's antique shops, searching for future heirlooms. With a little luck and a lot of serious targeting, you could reap a few of those same spoils in a single weekend. For starters, take a crash course in connoisseurship at the Splendid Peasant (Route 23 at Sheffield Road, South Egremont,413-528-5755), where folk-art antiques in museumlike displays carry auction-house prices. Study up on the best of the best before trying to unearth something nearly as good at the more than three dozen or so shops from Great Barrington south to the Connecticut border.
The lumber camp saws and ice tongs at Ole T. J.'s Antique Barn (649 South Main Street, Sheffield, 413-229-8382) may lack the provenance and patina of Splendid Peasant's antique eel spears, but they'll still look nifty over the fireplace. (Resist the urge to turn the tongs into a paper-towel holder.) Hill House Antiques (276 South Undermountain Road [Route 41], Sheffield, 413-229-2374), on the other hand, celebrates arts and crafts workmanship, from Stickley furniture to Rookwood ceramics. Painted Porch Country Antiques (102 South Main Street, Sheffield, 413-229-2700) breaks the American mold with English and French country furniture gathered by the owners on frequent buying trips. The barn showrooms smell like beeswax downstairs and sweet hay in the loft. And the 200-year-old Berkshire 1802 House (48 South Main Street, Sheffield, 413-229-2612) makes a convenient overnight stay while perusing Sheffield's concentration of dealers.
The closest thing to a metro center in these parts is Great Barrington, a hip town where the folks who made it desirable can no longer afford to live. Two of the better groups of shops with multiple dealers under one roof are the Emporium (319 Main Street, Great Barrington, 413-528-1660) for art glass and Victorian jewelry and the Great Barrington Antiques Center (964 South Main Street,Great Barrington, 413-644-8848) for country antiques and framed New Yorker covers (which speaks volumes about the clientele). One benefit of gentrification is good dining, and the best is the sublime Tuscan fare at Verdura (44 Railroad Street, Great Barrington, 413-528-8969).

UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN IT YEAR AFTER year, the arrival of the autumn forest is one of those unimaginable events, as weird as the nice neighbor down the street who turns out to be a serial killer. How on earth could these leathery green leaves turn not only yellow but the absolute essence of screaming yellow, not tinted orange but so orange you should stare at them through a filter to spare your eyes?
It seems unimaginable, too, that some fall soon that blaze will not appear. Unimaginable, but almost certain. Perhaps in my lifetime, definitely in my daughter's, unless we do extraordinary things to stop it.
Most of us have accepted that the world is growing slowly warmer because of the carbon that pours from our tailpipes, our chimneys, our power plants. But very few realize how fast and how thoroughly the climate is changing--realize, for instance, that the latest computer models indicate that later this century the climate of Boston is likely to be somewhere between the current climates of Richmond, Virginia, and Atlanta. A thousand practical dangers arise from that--everything from marshland inundation to mosquito infestation. But if you want to know what it will feel like--it will feel like no more autumn.
Already it's begun. In 1998, the warmest year on record, the fall saw a drab, muted, late display. Why? As researchers from the University of New Hampshire pointed out in last year's federally sponsored regional assessment of climate change, hard frosts "hasten the loss of chlorophyll and enhance the colors of the other pigments." Those frosts didn't come until November and December across much of the North Country, and so the glory was perceptibly dulled. In the years ahead, such damage will grow. Global warming drives up nighttime temperatures more than daytime highs. As a result, trees keep breathing all night, and that increased respiration robs the leaves of some of the sugars that keep them bright. And warming temperatures push pests into the region, robbing trees of the vigor that blasts through each fall.
Those shifts are minor compared to what will come during the next few decades. Since the late 19th century, we've seen temperature increases of about one degree, averaged globally. But the best guess is that the planet will warm 2 to 6 degrees more in the next century, and the models the UNH scientists used for New England suggest our totals may be slightly higher still. That's enough to make New England uninhabitable for beech and birch and maple--they'll want to be a couple of hundred miles farther north. In their place we can expect oak and hickory, the kind of forest that now dominates coastal Rhode Island. And you don't exactly see a flood of Vermont plates heading for Pawtucket come October: Oaks and hickories turn a nice greenish-brown.
Bundled children pulling sleds through snowy New England winters? By late this century, the computer models suggest warmer, shorter winters, especially in New England. Meanwhile, ponds and lakes will be less and less likely to freeze: In the past eight years, Lake Champlain froze solid only twice, the longest period of thaw in nearly two centuries of records. Pancakes on the griddle, with a big pitcher of this year's maple syrup? There's a reason no one sticks taps in oak trees come early March.
In other words, if you change the temperature, you change everything. Maybe you could genetically engineer oaks and hickories to turn yellow and red (and plant them along the Kancamagus Highway so they'd spell out the Monsanto logo)--but who would want to watch them on a muggy 80-degree October day? No, fall leaves go with apple snap and sweaters, and they lead into deer hunt and freeze-up, and it's all of a piece. Disconnected glory is only spectacle--might as well build an IMAX at the New Hampshire line.
What is to be done about all this? Well, nothing we seem willing yet to do. Turn in our gas-guzzlers for fuel-efficient hybrids (but the Senate this spring voted overwhelmingly against the idea, preferring a two-year delay in proposals to change the current standards). Stop generating our electricity from coal, and turn instead to windmills (like the ones Cape Codders are trying to block for fear they'll ruin the view from the chaise longue). Spend the money to shift from a fossil-fuel economy to a renewable-energy one (but a Bush administration report foresees that we will produce 43 percent more greenhouse gases by 2020).
So, in the meantime--like, this fall--what is to be done about all this? Watch the leaves with special care, with special urgency. Try to burn them onto your retina. And watch them from a bicycle or a bus. Not from your SUV--that would be ironic, and at least for now, the sheer enthusiasm of that blaze of color defies irony.
(4)TRACES OF GOLD //
By GEOFFREY NORMAN
Geoffrey Norman is a frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal, National Geographic Adventure, and Forbes FYI. His most recent book is Two for the Summit, his account of mountain climbing with his daughter.
AN AFTERNOON IN EARLY NOVEMBER and I was sawing beech and ash logs into 18-inch billets, then splitting them with a maul. I'd been at it for three or four hours and still had a long way to go. This was work I should have done last winter or even earlier. Firewood needs to age.
I had an alibi, though. I could honestly say I wasn't a Vermonter, merely another lowlife flatlander. I'd been raised in the South and then gone to live in the cities of the North, which I had then fled for the Green Mountains. I was so new to this life that I was still in love with my chain saw. While I felt bad about being so late doing this job and about the fact that I would be putting green wood in my wood stove, I was having a fine time. I was, to my surprise, in a trancelike state of contentment. I might even have been "happy."
Fourteen or so years later, I have long since fallen out of love with my chain saw. (It is now a marriage of convenience. I feed it gas and sharpen its steel teeth, and, in return, it cuts down trees for me when I absolutely must.) These days, I do not need the pretense of yeomanry and the feeling of virtue it inspires to bring on this sense of melancholy enchantment. It is enough to step outside--or merely look out of a window for a few minutes--on a day in late October or early November. This is, for me, like queuing music.
For the first few years after I'd moved to Vermont, I thought of "fall" and "foliage" as synonymous and I went all giddy when the leaves were at "peak." The hills beyond my house would be dazzling--a gaudy blend of red, orange, and yellow with even a little purple thrown in, and I would look up and think, Hell of a show, hell of a show. And when the inevitable cold front came through with enough wind and rain to bring down the leaves, I would close a conceptual door on the season. Fall, in all its glory, was done. Now, there was this interlude to get through before the first snow. And then it would be winter.
There was no name for these days, but I began to recognize them as a sort of season of their own and to actually look forward to it. The tourists would be gone, and while I didn't share some of my neighbors' misanthropic sense of superiority to the "Joeys," I wasn't sorry to see them go back to New Jersey. Leaf season could leave you feeling the way you do when your house is on the market and strangers are always looking in your closets.
Actually, this season between seasons had its own rhythms and its own strong appeal. It just took awhile to recognize it.
After the brilliantly colored leaves--mostly maple--were gone, there were still a few staunch holdouts. Aspen, chiefly. These leaves were gold and would still be there a couple of weeks after all the other leaves were down, even through the occasional dustings of snow. The hills would be barren and gray now except for these aspen leaves, resolutely hanging in there. Those touches of gold somehow relieved an otherwise depressingly monochromatic landscape and gave it an austere and poignant beauty. It was like going from Wordsworth to Yeats.
On a really good day, you could look up from your chores--sawing logs or putting the garden to bed for the winter, or, more prosaically, putting antifreeze in your truck--and feel strangely comforted by the sight of these last golden leaves. If it was a particularly good fall afternoon, the sky would be low and thick with ominous-looking clouds, and there would be formations of geese honking mournfully as they moved south ahead of the weather. You would feel the approach of winter right down to your bones and look forward to a fire that night in the fireplace.
Foliage, in the end, is fleeting and giddy and good for the postcard industry. It is Mardi Gras. What follows is Lent, a season of gravitas and the best sort of melancholy. This is the time when you are reminded most emphatically that winter is coming soon and, in the words of Jerry Garcia:
Gold will turn to gray
And youth will fade away
They'll never care about you
Call you old and in the way.
But on one of those good, gold November days, you can look up at the hills and feel--temporarily, anyway--like you can handle that. It's why you're here.
AUTUMN WEEKENDS
BIKING
This year, instead of watching fall's fiery display zoom past from inside a car, take to the roads by bike. While most foliage bicycle trips run three to six days, Plainfield, New Hampshire's Home Hill Inn has an enticing option for those who can spare only a weekend: The intimate 1818 French country inn, just crowned a Relais & Chateaux property, is offering a cycling package that includes a two-night stay, daily breakfast and gourmet dinner, plus use of the inn's bikes for exploring the surrounding hills, parks, covered bridges, and historic sites. Two hours from Boston, Plainfield is 20 minutes from Hanover, New Hampshire, and less than an hour from Woodstock, Vermont.
Chef Victoria du Roure, who co-owns Home Hill with her husband, Stephane, prepares all the meals at the inn--including her signature to-go French picnic basket, included in the package price. The fixings change every time: One day's picnic might be couscous with scallops or prosciutto; another's, cornichon sandwiches on crusty baguettes with fresh lobster-tarragon salad, adorable petits fours, and a bottle of Bordeaux. Proof that when it comes to civilization, apparently, you can take it with you.
Packages are priced from $ 548 per night for two, through October 31. Home Hill Inn, River Road, Plainfield, New Hampshire, 603-675-6165, www.homehillinn.com.

BLUE OCTOBER //
By ANNIE PROULX
Annie Proulx is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Shipping News.
I MOVED FROM VERMONT TO WYOMING seven years ago and did not expect to miss New England. Yearly, the Vermont snow had lessened in amount and quality, tending toward the sleety end of the stick; the traffic grew heavier, and, in autumn, swarms of hunters and leaf-color enthusiasts clogged the too-narrow, potholed roads. My house was too small for a growing number of books and research material. Trees bothered me--their dense shade, their impenetrable jungles of seedlings, the claustrophobic looming that cut off all but a small piece of sky. The hazy, polluted air cut visibility further. I was surrounded by an increasing number of neighbors, barking dogs, and No Trespassing signs. Then I began to worry after my first two books, Heart Songs and Other Stories and Postcards, that I might be turning into a regional writer. And I had itchy feet, a need to roam the back roads of the continent. Vermont seemed the kind of place where you stayed home.
For some years, I had been going out to Wyoming, a place where the sightlines are long and conducive to working out tight sentences. In fact, I thought of empty Wyoming as the ideal writing place for me. The sagebrush called.
What I liked most about Wyoming is that it was the emptiest of the states, with a population of about 494,000 in 98,000 square miles--10 times larger than Vermont but with a smaller population. Also, one of my French-Canadian ancestors had left his name there. Joseph Marie LaBarge had set out from Assomption in Quebec around 1808, shortly after his 21st birthday, and paddled alone to St. Louis. In the 1820s, he hired on with General William Ashley to trap beaver in the Rocky Mountains. He was with Ashley in 1823 in a fight with the Arikara on the Missouri, and later was one of the party on a tributary of the Green River in what is now Wyoming. In both places, his name is perpetuated in streams called LaBarge Creek. In Wyoming, the rather frowsty little town of LaBarge is also named for him.
In 1996, a few weeks after my mother died, I moved to Wyoming. I spent three or four months in Ucross, near the Montana border, then moved to a funky hamlet in the Medicine Bow range at an altitude of 8,100 feet. There I bought a house. Behind it is banked the great dark bulk of the Medicine Bow National Forest. To the east is Sheep Mountain and the Laramie Plain, still showing the old wheel ruts of the Overland Trail. South of the house is a crooked stream and a stand of aspen.
Wyoming's autumnal palette is more subtle than New England's flashing October burst. The high plains grasslands of eastern Wyoming sport Irish green for only a few weeks in springtime, a green that rather quickly transmutes to the color of straw gold. As the summer wears on, this color clarifies to a bright, almost transparent yellow. The vast miles of prairie glow. Here in the mountains, where I balance views of the plains below and the steep rocks and dark pine forests above, the first snow often comes in September. A light dusting of snow over the short, yellow grass creates a curious and beautiful color I have never seen anywhere else--a kind of shimmering, iridescent violet.
In October, the amber aspens burn against the somber lodgepole pine. From a distance the deep egg-yolk yellow drapes the mountains like unrolled bolts of Chinese silk. The willows that grow along watercourses go a brash yellow tinged with green. Rabbit brush takes yet another soft shade of yellow so that the entire luteous landscape comes in sheets of straw, citron, topaz, and old gold. Some shrubs go the red of dried blood, and the stems of osier glow like fireworks. There are 13 kinds of sagebrush, but their colors all fall into the silvery blue-gray-green register, a soft and melting hue. The closest New England gets to this color is in a mullein leaf, but sage is bluer and grayer. This horizontal gray landscape seems eerie and boring to those from greener worlds but sagebrush supports the Wyoming ecosystem and the diverse wildlife.
It is all intensely beautiful. And yet something familiar and as old to me as my own life is missing and always will be missing: the October smell of leaves and the decaying leaf mold of New England woods--earthy, mushroomy, root, and rock. I think often of a tiny spring that issued from the roots of an old yellow birch at my old Vermont home and spread out down the slope in a wet fan. It is amazing how much power olfactory memory packs. It is this distinctive odor of decaying leaves that I miss more intensely and terribly than the smash of swamp maple red. Wyoming is an arid place. Only after a rain does one suddenly get the flavors of the place--the famous terpenoids of the sagebrush, the resinous pines, grass and heat, the vixenish stink of animal burrows. The autumnal colors mute and fade quickly and scentlessly.
I sometimes think I will go to Vermont again one blue October and stop along a rainy back road when wet bark makes black trees and brings up the evocative and ancient smell of rot and decay, an odor I have known all my life but lost.
TAILGATING
Come fall, some of the region's best sporting rivalries heat up. What better way to fight the chill than to wrap up in a warm sweater and cheer on the home team? With the Head of the Charles Regatta under way on October 19, the banks of the Charles are prime tailgating territory. The South End's Flour Bakery offers tailgate-ready picnics of its signature pizza bread (baked pizza dough stuffed with a choice of meats, vegetables, sauce, and cheese), a field green salad, fresh baked goods, homemade granola, and drinks. Or choose from the bakery's selection of sandwiches, each served on freshly baked bread. Harvard fans can stock up for the annual showdown with Yale, this year in Cambridge on November 23, with a picnic to go from Cardullo's, where the made-to-order sandwiches and sumptuous desserts are enough to satisfy even the hungriest sports fan.

(6)WHERE I LIVE //
By MARY OLIVER
Mary Oliver is a Pulitzer Prize- and National Book Award-winning poet who lives in Provincetown and Bennington, Vermont.
NOW AND AGAIN, THE EARTH BEGINS to desire rest. And in the weeks of autumn, especially, it shows its disposition to calm, to what feels like a stasis, a pause. The ocean retains its warmth, while high, white cloud-boats ride out of the west. Now the birds of the woods are often quiet, but on the shore the migrating sanderlings and plovers are many and vocal, rafts of terns with the year's young among them come with the incoming tides, and plunge into the waves, and rise with silver leaves in their beaks. Where I live, on the harbor edge of the Cape's last town, perfect strangers walking along the beach turn and say to each other, without embarrassment or hesitation: "Isn't it beautiful!"
Indeed it is. We are gifted wherever we look--the asters, the goldenrod along the highways have taken heaven's light and dyed themselves with it, and so left us amid endless decoration. The first Eastham turnips--only as big as baseballs, but they will be larger in a few weeks--are sweet as honey. See them, piled on farm stands at the road's edge. And both the harborside and backshore waves, brisk so long in summer, come now to shore like waves half-asleep. In the woods, the buck I have seen all summer in his red coat has gone to market and exchanged it for a plain brown one, warmer, for the coming months. Did I not see him also last year? And the year before? Suddenly it crosses the mind--the here and the now are, at the same time, the everywhere and the forever.
I was born and raised deep inland, but no matter. In the '60s I first saw Provincetown and declared myself a citizen who, however long I might live, would look every day into the sea's blue expanse. Now I have come to my 43rd year in this town. For all towns it has been a difficult and painful year. Yet the apples are crisp and firm. In the pinewoods the mushrooms are plentiful and creatively placed among the shining needles. I pick them and store them; all winter they feed us. Also cranberries--I mean the wild ones--are many and gleaming in the curly bogs. For the gathering, workers use rakes, water, and machinery. In my own little bog I pick by hand, and with no haste. It is so pleasant in the afternoon light, what should compel me to hurry away? If a twig snaps and I raise my head, I will likely be looking into the gray eyes of the coyote who also, and as earnestly as I, is looking for his livelihood in this leafy place.
Somewhere among the writings of H. V. Morton is the thought--I don't remember the exact wording--that it is difficult, indeed impossible, to reconcile landscape, its grandeur and its serenity, with history. Morton wrote this while traveling in Italy. But it is true everywhere, even here on this silky fringe of land only a few thousand years old, for life is as much in the mind as in the eye, and no grievous event therefore is blotted out by distance.
But I think we do better than most places. There is a tradition on the Cape, and in my town especially, of patience and openness to change. There is plenty of attachment to the past, and voices can flare over the destruction of an old building, but at the end there appears a willingness to go forward, to accept the differences that must be, without collision.
We know there are more people coming every year to our personal paradise. No one, however, has yet suggested we close the bridge. And not only because of the commercial gain realized from tourism but also, I think, out of a sense of fairness--what we have in plenty and all year, surely should be available to everyone, at least for a while. And certainly this experience belongs to everyone, along with all the other experiences of the Cape--its art, its history, its rambunctiousness. Here are the ocean and wild dunes, here is downtown, here is my own cranberry bog. So the effort goes on--to accommodate more people, yet to keep intact the reasons they want to come here.
Autumn lasts only a few weeks, easing brightly colored, then darkening, like the ponds back of town. Now restaurants forget their icy desserts and begin to elaborate the chowders, the baked beans, the hot cider. How many people have found some pleasure here, from the broad reach of dune and marshland, from the hills of Truro, from the sea sparkle?
One fall day I drive downtown to pick up the mail. Members of a town crew are removing the "No Parking" signs, some of the men with familiar voices and faces, the sons of Provincetown people I knew 40 years ago. It is late afternoon, just a glimmer of the softest, quietest darkness in the air. When I descend the post office steps, I can feel, even here, a little sand under my shoes. And the long street, stringing past shop windows and houses unchanged from 100 years ago or standing in their renewed finery, is, for a moment, empty. B

12/31 THE POPS GET PUNKED 
When Boston's iconic piano-punk staple Amanda Palmer, long of the Dresden Dolls, announced she was canceling an intimate House of Blues show planned for November, she was quick with refunds and a promise to make it up to her fans. Tonight she makes good on that vow, teaming with the Boston Pops, which she collaborated with for a one-off show last summer. It's an exciting win-win: The Pops continues its reach for relevance (ahem, Red Sox album) while Palmer gives her fans a unique concert experience at Symphony Hall.

POLITICS
12/02 CAN THE REFORMERS BREAK THE BEACON HILL POWER GRIP? 
For the political activists at the -Committee to Fix Beacon Hill, the downfall of King Sal, a.k.a. disgraced former House Speaker Sal DiMasi, has provided nothing but momentum. The group has until today to file signatures for an initiative it wants on the 2012 ballot, an amendment that would require legislators to pick their leaders by secret ballot (to end fear of retribution) and would create a panel to dole out committee assignments (to lessen the sway of party power players). Of course, getting on the ballot requires more than mere John Hancocks: Somehow the group will also need to convince 25 percent of the legislature to agree to put the idea before voters. 
GOOD CHEER
12/03 SOME SAGE ADVICE FROM THE COMMON'S CHRISTMAS-TREE GUY
Sure, Mayor Tom Menino will get some attention when he throws the switch on Boston's Christmas tree tonight. But the guy who deserves the thanks for the conifer won't be freezing his fingers out there on the Common, he'll be at home in Nova Scotia. As the "Christmas-tree specialist" with Nova Scotia's Department of Natural Resources, Ross Pentz picks the spruce given to Boston each year, a tradition of gratitude for the aid that Bostonians rushed north in 1917 after an accident in Halifax Harbor killed almost 2,000 and injured another 9,000. 
 "It's a wonderful tree," Pentz says of the 48-foot white spruce he picked out. "It's getting harder to find the ones that are the right age and quality. I get called on a lot of wild goose chases. People think they've got what could be the Boston tree, and I come out and it's half as tall as it needs to be. They think it's pretty big, but I say, &Oelig;Call me in 10 years.'" 
Though you're not likely in the market for one of his tough-to-find 50-footers, Pentz knows what it takes to get the most out of any Christmas tree. Three points to consider: 
SIZE UP THE SELLER. "You want a dealer who hasn't mishandled the tree since it's been cut. This is important." 
CUT THE TRUNK STRAIGHT ACROSS. "A lot of people think a slanted cut helps expose more of the tree to the water. But if the water drops below the cut, you're just drying it out." 
PUT IT SOMEPLACE COOL. "Stick it in the coolest part of the room. Keep it out of the sun and heat," Pentz says. "This thing's used to being outside."

In deciding whether to ship the closer off, GM Theo Epstein must mind the ire of fans, whom he'll want in a chipper mood as tickets go on sale this month. 
On the Take
Department of Bright Ideas: Our Hapless Plunderers
Feeling guilty about that box of pens you lifted from the office? That's nothing. On 12/2 a pair of former state workers will learn what they owe in restitution for stealing truckloads of iron removed from the Longfellow Bridge. As incompetent as Richard Stewart and Joseph Falzone were as thieves, they were worse as salesmen: When they unloaded $900,000 worth of the historic ironwork at an Everett scrap yard, they fetched only $12,147.
Here's how their haul ranks among other schemes by state workers with sticky fingers: 
$9.4 million: Embezzled in a scheme by state treasury workers (1999) 
$1.5 million: Pocketed from MBTA counting rooms by a ring of workers (1984) 
$102,792 (and untold handfuls of coins): Raided from the campaign committee of John Buonomo, Middlesex register of probate, by the candidate himself; he also took change from office copy machines (2008) 
$76,000: Stolen by a teller from an RMV register in Milford (2005) 
$21,000 in MBTA fares and tokens: Pilfered by toll collectors (1993) 
COMEBACK
12/07 JOHN KERRY TO THE RESCUE!
Senator John Kerry's evolution into a  field agent for the Obama administration may not be surprising, after all, the two have been tight ever since Kerry invited Obama to give the keynote at the Democratic convention in 2004, launching the latter's national career, but the results have been a marvel to behold. It was to much fanfare that Kerry managed to broker a last-second deal with Afghan President Hamid Karzai to add legitimacy to elections in that country. Kerry also played mediator in disputes over Honduras and Syria, the sort of chore usually picked up by cabinet members. 
Today, as the United Nations opens a much-ballyhooed conference on climate change, expect our senior senator's star to shine even brighter. Already his efforts in pushing a climate-change bill have revealed him as an adept negotiator, able to coax Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (at considerable political risk) to coauthor a New York Times op-ed on the national security dangers of global warming. And now, as Kerry leads the U.S. delegation to the Copenhagen conference, look for him to muster those same skills to persuade the Chinese to adopt eco-friendly reforms. He's got a shot at negotiating something of a replacement agreement for the Kyoto Protocol, an environmental breakthrough that would go a long way toward reviving a popular political legacy that might otherwise have been left for dead in Ohio back in 2004. 
12/08 Today's Senate primaries mark the first step in unseating Senator Paul Kirk from his weeks-long incumbency. Finally.

GENETIC BREAKTHROUGH
12/14 SUPERSPAWN SLATED TO ARRIVE 
According to tabloid reports, today is the due date for Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen's baby, a birth no doubt eagerly awaited by geneticists hoping to understand the perfection of the species. It should also trigger an outbreak of cultural trendsetting in the Hub: Where the couple buys the family home, which stroller gets purchased, where the kid goes to school, these will long bear the Tom & Gisele brand. Get ready for loathsomely status-conscious parents to begin the copycatting!

Myth-Buster
Nobel prize winner Dr. Jack Szostak gives it to us straight
On 12/10 Szostak, a doctor who plumbs the mysteries of cancer and aging at Mass General, will be awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine, which makes this a fine time to dispel some popular myths concerning the august award. 
MYTH #1: It garners instant respect. "My two sons, who are 9 and 13, weren't all that impressed until the other kids at school began talking about it, then it became cool." 
MYTH #2: Meeting European royalty is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "It's similar to the Heineken Prize [which Szostak won in 2008], when you meet the prince of the Netherlands. It'll be fun, but it doesn't faze me." 
MYTH #3: The high point of the weeklong festivities is the formal banquet. "My wife and sons and I are doing some sightseeing, including the Vattenmuseum [Stockholm's aquarium], which is supposed to be spectacular. We're pretty excited about that." 
MYTH #4: The $1.4 million prize can buy a great yacht. "How about college educations?" 
MYTH #5: It'll be awesome to hang out with fellow prize winner Barack Obama. While most of the Nobels are awarded in Stockholm, the peace prize ceremony is in Oslo. Bummer. 
CRIME
12/14 CAN A TRIAL BE A SALVE IN THE SOUTH END? 
The murder trial of Steven Odegard, which opens today, has been a long time coming. He is accused of the January 2008 murder of Daniel Yakovleff, whom Odegard allegedly picked up at a South End bar and who was later found stabbed to death inside Odegard's apartment. 
The murder sent a shock wave through the local gay community and was seized upon by some who claim there's scant news coverage and slow justice when gays are victimized. This summer the LGBT community decried the sentence for a man who pleaded guilty to a series of charges stemming from the beating of three men and a woman on Columbus Avenue. The attacker was ordered to pay his victims' medical bills and stay out of the South End. Similarly, there was outrage that the story of a student robbed, beaten, and taunted with homophobic epithets outside a South End bar in May 2008 appeared only in Bay Windows, the city's LGBT newspaper. 
As for Odegard, Boston police, who had initially dismissed him as a suspect, took nearly a year to indict him, and the Globe's first story on the murder didn't appear until eight days after the crime. All of which means that those paying close attention to the trial will be hoping to have company on the sidelines.

Perhaps the most perpetually put-off idea in town, the Green Line expansion into Somerville and Medford is compelled by law to be finished exactly five years from today. (Yeah, we're not holding our breath either.)

Santa Science
In his new book, Canton's Gregory Mone shows how Saint Nick has gone high-tech  
Boston: As a science writer, you certainly do eschew the Rockwellian version of Santa. 
Gregory Mone: I definitely had the idea of modernizing him. I don't think he'd be smoking a pipe anymore. I don't think he'd have a big belly. He'd be more conscious of that. 
Boston: And he'd embrace all kinds of wild technology to make his job possible? 
Mone: The book is about amazing things that are happening in science today, and our incredible potential. To an extent, it's about how science makes the impossible possible. In some cases it's about very real things that are happening now, like unmanned aerial vehicles, and in some cases it's far-out concepts like wormholes and time travel. And who knows? There could be a nice benefit here. If kids stop worrying about flying reindeer and start thinking about warp drive, we might grow new scientists and engineers. 
Boston: So you could say your book might save the American economy. That would be quite a boast for an author to make. 
Mone: Listen, I'm not saying it's a good book. I'm just saying, yes, The Truth About Santa will probably save our economy.

Point Man
Twelve years ago, WBUR's Tom Ashbrook had never worked in radio. Today, from his small Boston studio, he hosts one of the most popular and influential shows on public radio, heard each week on 240 stations nationwide. And he's only just getting started.
By Peter Vigneron
It isn't easy to speak cogently and think at the same time, but Tom Ashbrook is very good at it, and he is sometimes impatient when guests on his radio show, On Point, are not.
On a Thursday morning in December, during a segment titled "What to Do About Climate Change?" he challenged Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of Georgetown University's Climate Center, to say which policy measures might slow global warming, and how those measures might change contemporary society. Arroyo suggested tightening both emissions standards and the rules on coal-burning power plants, and then seemed to argue that doing so would be mostly painless. Ashbrook grew incredulous.
During shows, Ashbrook spends much of his time scribbling notes or circling ones that he has already taken. The desk he uses while on air, in Studio 3 at WBUR, is covered by an expansive, ever-shifting puzzle of paper photocopies of articles, excerpts from books, studies that he refers to throughout the show. But when Ashbrook wants to interject, he raises one or both hands in the air. If he is in the studio alone, which is the case most of the time, it looks like he's gesturing for the attention of one of the On Point producers, who are stationed 10 feet away on the other side of a double-thick wall of glass. The first time I saw him do this, during a segment in late November, I thought something had gone wrong. But Ashbrook was in fact simply preparing for what was to come next, a bit like an -orchestra conductor between movements of a symphony, only with himself as both conductor and orchestra. Once he begins speaking, his hands drift back to the table, and he resumes fidgeting.
"But what about in our daily lives?" he asked Arroyo. "If we're gonna get on top of this, are we gonna have to live different lives than we live now, in some fundamental ways? Or what?"
"Technology is part of it," Arroyo said, "and so the car you drive now might be different than the car you "
"We got that. Yup."
" otherwise would drive. But you know, if we change where the power comes from, do you know where the electrons in your own home come from? I don't think necessarily "
"Okay, that's two, we got that. There's your power plants. Take us on."
After some hemming and explaining, Arroyo arrived at a tax on carbon emissions, though it was Ashbrook who finally used the phrase "carbon tax." Ashbrook does not relish discussing his political views, but he told me later that global warming is an issue of importance to him. He was anxious to move the hour beyond the usual talking points. Intellectually, he is a man of action, and he was bored.
Anybody who listens to On Point will eventually confront the fact that Ashbrook soaks up an unusually large volume of information. He seems able to talk intelligently about almost anything. "There are other talk-show hosts, they do a great job," says Jack Beatty, On Point's news analyst. "But man, his capacity!" Graham Allison, of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and a past guest on the show, told me that Ashbrook's command of international affairs occasionally outdoes his own. Driving one day in November, I caught a snippet of a segment on the film adaptation of Anna Karenina, during which Ashbrook delivered a relatable summary of Tolstoy's ideas about fidelity and happiness, apparently off the cuff and without sounding pretentious. That was in hour two. In hour one, he'd looked at the implications of several recent leadership changes in China's ruling politburo. This is what he does five days a week, 50 weeks a year. An hour on the Congo that segues into an hour on Dolly Parton. Assisted suicide followed by the super wealthy. In just one week this past December, Ashbrook did shows on drones, the fiscal cliff, the American Revolution, the recently deceased jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, and domestic violence and the NFL. Since 2001, he has hosted more than 5,000 hours of radio.
Ashbrook is blunter than most NPR hosts. He frequently interrupts his guests to summarize what they are saying and then to pose another question. At times this lends the impression that he is answering his own questions, but more often than not it makes for potent, urgent conversation. (He is noticeably gentler with callers.) One former On Point producer told me that Ashbrook's ability to host at the same speed that listeners hear to anticipate questions and challenges, and then ask them as they arise in listeners' minds is as good as that of anyone he has worked with in radio. Ashbrook believes this quality is deeply satisfying for his audience.
Oddly, when On Point launched in 2001, six days after the 9/11 attacks, originally as special coverage for NPR, Ashbrook had never worked in radio. In fact, he had fled news altogether a half decade earlier, after a distinguished career at the Globe. When WBUR called, looking for a host, he was off trying to raise venture capital for a tech startup and was writing a novel. It was not obvious that he would be a good host, or that he even wanted to be a journalist again.
But Ashbrook has proved himself a natural. Since 2005, On Point has more than doubled its listenership. It is now among the most popular shows on public radio, ranking just behind the BBC's Newshour, and not far behind The Diane Rehm Show, which has been on the air far longer. The show is heard each week by 1.2 million people on 240 stations nationwide, and each month by another 680,000 who download the podcast. In Boston, the show is on air for a remarkable four hours a day, five days a week: from 10 a.m. until noon, when it's broadcast live, and then in a repeat from 7 p.m. Until 9. Ashbrook would eventually like his show to get airtime on every public-radio station in the United States, and he is excited about his international listenership. It's only a small exaggeration to say that he intends to become ubiquitous and then to remake the world, one spirited, thoughtful, and no-nonsense hour of conversation at a time.
After thanking Arroyo for coming on air, and taking a short break between segments, Ashbrook got back in the booth for the day's second hour: a look at the best books of 2012. Ashbrook is 57, and in photographs he often appears hunched over a table in the radio booth, wearing headphones, which makes him look small and a little bit sallow. He is actually quite large: 6-foot-4 and solidly built, with a shock of blond hair and a wide face.
The transition from the first hour, which is usually hard news and analysis, to the second one, usually arts and culture, often requires Ashbrook to take a wholly different approach to questioning his guests. (A particularly difficult sequence came on December 17, when he moved from the Newtown school shootings to Mayan cosmology, fielding calls from two very different groups of people who were worried about the end of the world.) The six minutes between segments are filled with a national news roundup from NPR, a prerecorded teaser from Ashbrook about the upcoming segment, and two minutes of headlines from WBUR. Behind the scenes, these minutes can be quite hectic. While I was visiting, there was a moment of frenzy when the staff couldn't get Elizabeth Taylor, the literary editor for the Chicago Tribune, patched in from New York. (Unbeknownst to them, she had been assigned to an alternate studio at WBEZ at the last minute.) But by the time Ashbrook was back live, at 11:06:30, they were ready to go.
On Point is one of the few national radio programs that devotes entire hours to new books, and several of the authors being discussed that day, including Hilary Mantel and Junot Daz, had previously been guests on the show. Unlike the host of the very popular NPR talk show Fresh Air, Terry Gross, Ashbrook is not obsessive about reading every page of the books he discusses, although often he does, especially if the book has literary, rather than simply informational, merit.
Twenty minutes into the segment, Ashbrook invited his listeners to call in and share their favorite books from the year. Before the callers came on air, a producer quickly researched the books they wanted to talk about and gave Ashbrook one-sentence summaries, which lent the impression that he was familiar not only with the books being discussed by his guests but also with the personal favorites of David from San Francisco and Jane from Braintree. In all my visits to WBUR, this was the only sleight of hand I ever saw Ashbrook perform.
The On Point staff is about 10 strong, and relies at times on freelancers for help. Each day after work, Ashbrook leaves for home with a 20-to-40-page packet, put together by his producers, which he reads and annotates between 6 and 10 p.m. He wakes at 5 a.m. and is at the station, on Commonwealth Avenue, by 7. At 8, the day's lead producers, who are responsible for the packets and securing guests, and the show's executive producer, Karen Shiffman, meet with Ashbrook in the On Point bullpen, a rectangular cubicle-style workspace in the middle of WBUR's main floor. I was surprised to learn that Ashbrook does not prepare questions in advance, or even think very much about the structure of his interviews, because doing so distracts him from being present with his guests. "I'm a big fan of mindfulness," he says. "I want to be so engaged with the issue that the questions are just brimming, and so aware of what people want to learn that the arc of the show creates itself in real time."
Seven of the On Point staff are producers, meaning they help usher shows from the idea stage through broadcast. Most are responsible for two shows each week, and find themselves involved in everything from the advance reading of books to helping Ashbrook come up with a show's angle. The majority of the work, though, involves research and scheduling guests, providing Ashbrook with a high-density reading diet, and making sure he's talking to people who are among the most qualified in the world on a given hour's subject. (Paul Krugman, Camille Paglia, Ken Jennings, Jared Diamond, and Willie Nelson are among those who appeared on the show in the past four months.) Because most shows are intensely topical, Ashbrook and his producers rarely plan more than a week in advance.
When Ashbrook is on air, four staffers are stationed in the production studio: the technical director, James Ross, who manages sound; the director, Eileen Imada, who communicates directly with Ashbrook when he is in the studio; the day's lead producer, who stands in front of a computer screen, keeping watch over the show's trajectory and doing spot research; and a second producer, who answers the phones.
Taking calls is an art, and it begins with the screeners, although it is Ashbrook who makes final decisions about who to bring on air. After speaking with the caller, the screener will punch into the computer a one- or two-sentence summary of the point or question. This information is displayed on screens in front of both Imada and Ashbrook. Once the call-in segment gets going, Ashbrook will have six callers to choose from at any time, with about two-thirds of those who make it through the screeners getting a chance to talk. New Englanders are well represented in the queue, but because Ashbrook aspires to a national audience and a diversity of views, they're slightly less well represented on the air. About 50 times per hour the screener tells callers, "Say,  Hi, Tom,' not  Good morning,'"  to avoid confusion when the show is rebroadcast in the evening.
At any given moment in the production studio, there are at least three conversations happening at once: Ashbrook's with his guests; the callers with the screener; and Imada with the hour's producer. For the production staff, focusing on the show itself is very hard. According to Shiffman, Ashbrook will sometimes ask them how a segment went, and they won't be able to answer.
Ashbrook was born and raised in Illinois, and lived a mildly itinerant early childhood, moving around the state with his family as his father, Dave, sold farm equipment. In the mid-1960s, when Ashbrook was in the fourth grade, Dave Ashbrook went broke after a business venture making plastic cups failed. The family moved back to where his mother had been raised, a farm in Bloomington that was settled by her ancestors in 1822.
Despite the circumstances, Ashbrook's upbringing was remarkably outward-looking. His parents were both the first in their families to graduate from college. His father had served abroad in the Army, and his mother maintained ties in Scandinavia. The family also served as hosts for an international-youth farm exchange, so Ashbrook grew up alongside a rotating crew of Kenyans, Nicaraguans, and Egyptians. "It was very rural, it was very church oriented, it was very agricultural," Ashbrook says. "But it was by no means blinkered or unworldly. My mother was a great internationalist. When she sang 'Kumbaya,' she meant it."
Ashbrook blossomed in high school, where he became student-body president, and enrolled at Yale in the fall of 1973. He was ambitious and hard-working, but Yale, secular and urban, was a shock for a churchgoing farm boy, and by his sophomore year he was considering dropping out. Instead, a friend persuaded him to try going abroad, after noticing his fascination with a class at the Divinity School on India's vedantic mysticism. Ashbrook applied to one of the only study-abroad programs then operating in the country, at the University of Wisconsin, and convinced his high school girlfriend, Danielle Guichard, to do the same. The pair spent the next year together in India. Ashbrook returned to Yale for a final semester, completed a degree in history early, and then paid off his loans by working as a blaster for an oil-prospecting outfit in Alaska.
Tom and Danielle married, and in 1977 he was awarded a fellowship from the Yale-China Association. It was a big deal China was still closed to the West. Ashbrook learned to speak Cantonese at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, taught English for a year, and worked part time as a host for a local English-language TV station, introducing movies in the evening. A crew of British actors saw him on TV and asked him to help dub old kung fu films into English. Ashbrook and the actors then wrote scripts conjured out of whole cloth and recorded the parts themselves. Hong Kong was also where Ashbrook began working as a reporter, for the South China Morning Post, and he found that it was a good time to be a journalist in Asia: With China liberalizing and Vietnam going to pieces, there were stories, sometimes two or three, to write each day.
After four years in Hong Kong, the Ashbrooks moved to Boston in 1981, in part so Tom could take a shot at writing for the Globe, which then had one of the two or three best foreign desks in the world. He got in by sneaking past a security guard at the headquarters on Morrissey Boulevard, and then by talking his way into a few freelance assignments. His first real beat was City Hall, where he learned Boston Irish politics and quickly worked his way up at the paper. In 1983, the Globe named him its Asian bureau chief and sent him to Tokyo. His territory stretched, as he puts it, "from Hokkaido to the Khyber Pass," a vastness that suited him. One of his early assignments was covering Indira Gandhi's assassination and its aftermath, when hundreds of Sikhs were massacred. After filing his copy, he had to clean blood off his shoes.
In 1988, he returned to Boston as the Globe's foreign editor, and stayed until 1996, eventually rising to deputy managing editor. His decision to leave was complicated but involved many of the elements of a midlife crisis: He had been passed over for a promotion, he had burned out after a decade of constant travel and 60-hour workweeks, and he wanted to try his hand at something new. These were the early years of the dot-com bubble, and like so many others, Ashbrook had dreams of getting ahead on something big, and maybe striking it rich. For four years, he and a college friend named Rolly Rouse developed plans for a company called -HomePortfolio.com, devoted to the idea of digitizing home design. By 1999, they had raised more than $70 million in venture funding, but as the dot-com bubble began to pop, Ashbrook and the investors fell out over the company's direction, and he and Rouse left. In 2000 he published a book about the experience, titled The Leap: A Memoir of Love and Madness in the Internet Gold Rush.
In the spring of 2001, Ashbrook and Rouse were working on a second business idea when Christopher Lydon, the longtime host of WBUR's flagship talk show, The Connection, parted ways with the station after a salary dispute. Suddenly, one of the highest-profile broadcast jobs in the city was open, and Ashbrook who had begun working as a public speaker was asked by Jane Christo, then the general manager of WBUR, to audition. Christo's call came out of the blue, but Ashbrook decided to try out, as did Jack Beatty, a longtime Atlantic editor and writer; Dick Gordon, the Canadian radio veteran; and Neal Conan, who now hosts NPR's Talk of the Nation. Gordon got the job, but Ashbrook did surprisingly well during his audition.
On the morning of September 11, Ashbrook and Rouse were in Westport, Connecticut, for a venture capital meeting, when the first plane hit the World Trade Center. Everyone gathered in a conference room and watched on television as the second plane hit and the buildings came down. Ashbrook, who had a meeting scheduled for later that day in Manhattan, instead headed straight back to Boston.
The 9/11 attacks set journalists across the country off on a frantic all-hours search for information. But those in New York and Washington also had to contend with the chaos created by the attacks themselves, including, for instance, the destruction of WNYC's broadcast antenna. The nonstop work took its toll at NPR, which, worried that its staff was nearing exhaustion, considered cutting live coverage in the evenings. Learning this, Christo suggested that WBUR could fill in. She had recently overseen an expansion of the station's staff and believed she had the resources to put together three hours of news and analysis each night out of Boston.
Christo and her team asked Graham Griffith, a producer then working on a newsmagazine project in Providence, to organize a show. Griffith had been collaborating with a producer at WBUR named Ian Docherty, and they had both advocated for Ashbrook when he tried out for The Connection, in part because of Ashbrook's background in foreign reporting. "He came without any radio experience," Griffith says, "but he had all of the things that I want all public-radio hosts to have, that you can't teach: the combination of genuine curiosity, a deep understanding of what's going on in the world, and mental agility." Plus, Griffith and Docherty knew Ashbrook was working on a book that fall meaning he was available. (The book was a -thriller about technology and terrorism, and Ashbrook immediately lost his appetite for completing it.)
Ashbrook had seen his faith in journalism's ability to change the world wane in the 1990s, but when he got the call from WBUR five days after the attacks asking him to host a program called, simply, Special Coverage, he didn't hesitate. "Nine-eleven just smacked me upside the head," he says. "It felt like this is no time for crumpets and tea. We've got urgent issues. We need to cut through to the heart of things." The show went live in the evenings on Monday, September 17, with Ashbrook as host and Beatty, a longtime on-air contributor to WBUR, helping with analysis. Ashbrook and the producers didn't have a workspace, so the team set up on folding chairs in WBUR's cafeteria. In a collision of personalities that could have happened only in public radio, the cafeteria was also the favorite area for Tom and Ray Magliozzi, the Car Talk guys. "It was nearly impossible for anyone to prepare serious radio with them yucking it up in the background," Griffith says.
The early shows, most of which are still available online, were produced in an atmosphere of crisis and uncertainty. They are unexpectedly good. According to Griffith, Ashbrook picked up the basics of radio introducing guests, taking callers, minding the clock very fast, and needed little coaching when it came to asking the right question at the right time. He managed to be skeptical without being cynical, and the show attracted ratings that were higher than anyone at WBUR had expected.
NPR distributed Special Coverage for less than a month and then returned the show to WBUR as the crisis receded. Instead of shutting it down, Christo asked Griffith to move up to Boston permanently, and for the next four years, WBUR lobbied to have the show, renamed On Point, re-included among the 14 or 15 regionally produced talk shows vying for national airspace. But again and again Ashbrook ran up against concerns that he was too aggressive for the NPR mold. "I'll get tougher and a little more rugged sometimes than NPR hosts generally do," Ashbrook says, acknowledging that NPR was worried about this trait. But listeners responded well to his style, and in 2005, after Dick Gordon's struggling Connection was taken off air, NPR began distributing On Point nationally.
In the years since, Ashbrook has gained more control over the tenor of his voice, drawing out and emphasizing certain words and weighting his questions with feeling. This has the strange effect of making shows in 2013, even about subjects such as tax deductions and lobsters, somehow feel more urgent than shows that ran in the weeks after 9/11. Otherwise, though, the formula that was put in place in the fall of 2001 a two-hour call-in show, devoted to understanding the world in all its facets is the formula that is still in place today.
On Point involves a great deal of work, almost a brute-force approach to high-quality news analysis, and Ashbrook expects quite a bit. "He does have a lot of energy, and a lot of force, and I think a radio show is a good place to put it," Karen Shiffman says. Creating the show requires a large staff by public--radio standards, and WBUR spends more to produce the show than it generates in underwriting or licensing royalties. (The WBUR station manager, Corey Lewis, who oversees the station's distribution and marketing, estimates that On Point will become profitable if it reaches markets in 80 percent of the country which he projects could happen in seven years.) But that's the thing about public radio: Because of its revenue sources overwhelmingly, listener contributions and corporate underwriting, with a small federal subsidy it is less dependent on high ratings, and less pressured to make the news sensational. Ashbrook and his staff believe that a vigorous, ideologically neutral conversation serves a public good, and they are allowed to devote themselves to making it happen.
Still, the media landscape is changing, and although public radio has remained healthy, it has had its own problems attracting a broad, young listenership. In the past five or so years, much of the excitement and energy in public radio has been around shows and special series with a strong narrative component This American Life, Radiolab, Planet Money, The Moth. Story shows, not talk shows.
This doesn't worry Ashbrook. "I love that people are being innovative," he says. "But I think that deeply engaged, straight-ahead conversation about what's going on in the world is always going to have a big audience. There's -essentially a limitless audience for where we're going, what we're doing here."
In The Leap, Ashbrook writes at length about his feeling of restlessness, his suspicion that the world was changing, and his determination not to be left behind. That didn't strike me as the profile of a guy who sticks with a job for 11 years, so I asked him why he has stayed so long on the same show, especially one that won't let him go out and experience the world firsthand. Off air, Ashbrook is a warm conversationalist, every bit as engaged as he is on the show, but without the insistent, impatient quality that characterizes his on-air persona. There are two reasons, he explained. The first is that he simply doesn't have time to be restless. Hosting On Point is too demanding. The second is that in some sense the show does transport him out into the world. "I can be sitting in the studio here," he says, "and something is going on in some very distant, different environment, and I have a tangible, palpable sense memory of it. If we're talking about Goma, in the Congo? I remember how it smelled. China? Asia? I've been all over it."
On Point has always strived to provide its listeners with a national perspective, and Ashbrook is pleased that his show, produced far up in the liberal Northeast, now reaches a large and more--conservative audience in the South and the mountain West. As a longtime foreign correspondent, he's also eager to expand that reach internationally and it's happening. In a single month last year, the On Point website, which streams the show live worldwide, attracted visitors from 153 countries.
Ashbrook takes great pride in his increasingly global audience, something I witnessed this past November, when a caller from India appeared in his queue. Delighted, Ashbrook broke away from his guests. "We've got a call coming in from Mumbai," he said. "Jaidev, thanks for calling from Mumbai. You're on the air. What's your question?"

Beyond merely writing checks , though , the Hostetters are influencing future generations of philanthropists with the Barr Fellowship program, which provides training and a three-month sabbatical for rising stars in the world of charityincluding leaders such as John Barros , number 13 on our list .

All-Purpose Power Broker
Board Memberships: Connors Family Foundation , Boston College, Camp Harbor View , Harvard School of Public Health , Partners in Health
Recent Activity : Led the $62 million drive for the Campaign for Catholic Schools in 2012
How influential is Connors?

At Boston College, the Hill Holliday founder has sat on the board of trustees since 1979 and (twice) been chairman , and he funded the Connors Family Retreat and Conference Center . And after a falling-out with the Archdiocese of Boston related to the sex abuse scandal, he returned to help lead the $62 million Campaign for Catholic Schools. At Brigham and Women's, meanwhile, he was a driving force behind the Mary Horrigan Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology. Then there's the $45 million he's raised for Mayor Menino's pet project, the Camp Harbor View summer camp for at -risk Boston kids . In other words, Jack Connors is , as one of the city's most prominent businessmen told us ,the beacon of philanthropy for the city of Boston .

Yankee Thrift
Are we truly a bunch of cold -hearted cheapskates in Massachusetts?
By Patrick Doyle
Last August , the Chronicle of Philanthropy published a study showing that New England was home to the six least charitable states in the countryMassachusetts ranked 47th . The conservative bloggerati nearly had a heart attack of joy. Jeff Jacoby , as is his wont , went apoplectic in the Globe, deriding thestingy liberals  around here , and proclaiming that all of our blue -state talk of equality , fairness , and helping one another was total hogwash. Except it wasn't.
The Chronicle of Philanthropy's ratings were not very accurate or substantial,  says Paul Schervish, the director of Boston College's Center on Wealth and Philanthropy .It was an attempt to do something that was entertaining . 
To start with , the Chronicle included religious giving in its rankings , despite the fact that a good portion of church donations go not to the poor but to things like church services . When such giving was removed, the Chronicle acknowledged , the Northeast was actually the most generous region in the country, giving 1.4percent of its discretionary income to secular charities.
Beyond that , the Chronicle survey included only people with incomes of more than $50 ,000(which eliminates half of America) and people who itemize their deductions (which is done by about a third of the country) . In fact , the study took into account just two-thirds of overall individual annual giving . And the Chronicle also used some less -than -fair estimates of cost of living , which punished people in expensive areaslike the Northeast.
In fact , when Schervish released his own studyone that included estimates of non-itemized givingMassachusetts ranked as the 13th -most -generous state in the country. Even in the BC rankings , though , Maine and New Hampshire remained among the bottom three states . Our cheap neighbors are killing our reputation .

The Art of the Ask
How nonprofits turn the wealthy into donors .
 By Patrick Doyle
Whenever news of a huge donation breaks , everyone wonders: How on earth did that nonprof convince that businesswoman/doctor /tech entrepreneur to write a check for $10 million? People don't just hand money over on a whim , right? Most likely , not.
Closing the deal on a big donation takes months , if not years, of groundwork .Ultimately , a gift is never about you asking for the gift ,  says Northeastern University president Joseph Aoun , who oversaw a $60 million deal last year to rename the business school after local entrepreneurs Richard D'Amore and Alan McKim, both Northeastern grads.It's about the person who is going to make the gift . 
Every major institution, as well as many medium -size ones , employs adevelopment team tasked with finding leads for new donors . (Board members help with the hunt as well . ) The process starts with trying to identify people who are capable of writing a seven-figure check, and who might be interested in the nonprofit. Typically, it starts with questions like these: Did anyone at that tech company with the planned IPO attend our university ? Any chance that hedge fund manager, who grew up poor , is interested in funding scholarships ?
Assuming there's interest , the institution moves on to the long , slow dance of cultivation. A board member might invite the new prospect to a low-key event and introduce him or her to a few people . That's followed with a thank- you note and a proposal for an introduction to the executive director at an upcoming gala . Eventually , the discussion gets around to the target's passions , and about his or her opinions about the nonprof itself : What do you think of our direction? What can we be doing better ? From there, the nonprofit begins to put together a few ideas for a possible gifta new museum wing , the endowment of a university department chair, an expansion to the homeless shelter. Then , says Dan Kirsch , an Amherst-based development consultant , the executive director or board chairman might tell the prospect :We've talked about our vision and we have an opportunity that we would like to offer to you. Here's the impact the gift would have . 
After the check is signed , successful organizations continue to engage the donor.You keep them involved ,  says Alan Cantor , a nonprofit consultant in Concord, New Hampshire.Eventually , there will be a bigger campaign when you can approach them for a larger gift . You need to figure out how to form a friendship . 
Developing that relationship is essential to keeping the gifts flowing. As Northeastern's Aoun puts it :Every person has a passion. If their passion and our goals intersect and we can become stewards of their passion, then that is what it takes.

Seth Priebatsch believes puzzles and challenges have the power to change human behavior. A lot of very smart tech investors believe Priebatsch and his Cambridge company have the power to change the world.
IN THE FALL OF 2007, Seth Priebatsch headed off to Princeton and, a few weeks after arriving on campus, learned about the school's annual business-plan contest. Before Priebatsch even entered, he likes to boast, he knew he would win it. 
There was good reason for his optimism. Priebatsch was 12 years old when he started his first company, Giftopedia.com, a price-comparison website that helped users locate good deals. (He found the site's programmers while on a family vacation to India.) At least twice while at school, he had to run out of class to deal with server outages. "I explained to my teachers calmly that I really had to leave and take care of this," he recalls. Priebatsch sold off most of the company when he was 15, and the Web address when he was 17. Then, as a high school senior, he launched his second startup, PostcardTech. This one created and distributed promotional CDs for universities and tourist destinations. He rented out a factory in China-which is "way easier than it sounds," he says. "Do a bit of research, get the right numbers, fire up Skype, dial." (He still owns PostcardTech, though he has no involvement in running it.)
For the Princeton competition, he decided on a proposal for a company that would use text messages to lead mobile-phone-based scavenger hunts. After hashing out the idea with a professor, Priebatsch drew up his plan. And, as he'd predicted, he won. When the $5,000 prize came in the form of a giant poster check, Priebatsch ran to the nearest Bank of America and made a big scene of trying to jam the check into an ATM. It was a grand time, he says, until "they called the police and we had to leave."
Three years later, Priebatsch's freshman-year business plan has blossomed into arguably the most-talked-about young tech company in the country, the Cambridge-based SCVNGR. These days, Priebatsch, who is 22, is as well known for his engineering wizardry as his, um, youthful energy. He rides a scooter around his office. He unloads Nerf guns on his unsuspecting employees. He always wears orange sunglasses and, like a cartoon character, dresses himself in the same outfit every day: an orange shirt (an ode to Princeton, and without a doubt a branding ploy as well).
He is often barefoot, too. He greets friends barefoot. He greets journalists barefoot. He even greets clients barefoot. That's the type of thing you get to do when you drop out of one of the best schools in the country after just one year to start a company that quickly scores VC funding from high-roller investors like Highland Capital Partners and Google, and today is estimated to be valued at $100 million. You also get to call yourself "Chief Ninja" instead of CEO. And you apparently get to use vowels only when you want: SCVNGR is pronounced "Scavenger." Finally, you get to deliver one of the keynote addresses at the 2011 South by Southwest tech conference-the same keynote given three years earlier by another Ivy League dropout, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
Priebatsch's company produces smartphone apps designed to draw people to businesses and then build consumer loyalty. Basically, the SCVNGR app is meant to engage users in games and challenges-at, say, a local bar-that earn customers discounts and freebies. The idea is that app users will eventually become regulars at the bar.  
Priebatsch spends nearly every waking moment thinking about SCVNGR, and rarely leaves his office near Kendall Square. When I go to meet him there, he bursts out from behind a wall-"Hey!"-and strides toward me much too quickly, as if he's competing in the Olympic power walk. Leading me on a tour of the office, Priebatsch shows me the spot under his desk where he routinely unfurls a sleeping bag at night. He doesn't have an apartment, so he spends his evenings at either SCVNGR or his parents' house in the Back Bay, where he sleeps in his childhood bedroom, complete with glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling. For a man who gets people at bars to play games, he does not have much of a social life. His father, Norman, says he's not sure what Seth's up to on those nights he doesn't make it home, but "all I can tell you is, it ain't with a girlfriend." The son, though, shrugs it off, noting in his faint South African accent (Norman is from South Africa) that female companionship "lessens efficiency."
Priebatsch's single-mindedness stems from his absolute conviction, shared by many others, that what SCVNGR is building will do nothing less than change society's behavior. He starts to unpack this thought as he shows me SCVNGR's main conference room. It's an airy space, with openings at the corners of each of the four bamboo-paneled walls and a round table in the middle. A shiny black globe, tilted on its axis, sits at the center of the table. Priebatsch thinks SCVNGR can grow to be a billion-dollar company, and seems to be only half-joking when he says the conference room "is used to plot world domination." Indeed, Priebatsch is on a very specific mission. He will not stop, he says, until SCVNGR "builds a game layer on top of the world."
SO JUST WHAT IS A GAME LAYER, and why does the world need one on top of it? Priebatsch explains that the past 10 years have been dominated by social media providing people with a way to have the social interactions they already want. Facebook, for example, makes it easier to connect with your Aunt Edna in Kentucky or keep up with your college buddies. The next iteration of social media, Priebatsch believes, isn't about helping people do what they want-it's about influencing them to do what you want. 
So how do you do that? Priebatsch has devoured the academic literature on game mechanics, identifying individual dynamics that can affect behavior. Some are as simple as what he calls the "appointment dynamic," which involves giving people a reward for being in the right place at the right time, such as with a happy hour. Others are more complex, like the "variable interval rewards schedule" dynamic, which holds that rewarding people on an irregular basis will keep them working at a more consistent rate than rewarding them on a fixed schedule. The game-dynamics theory boils down to this: A little extra motivation can influence your behavior in ways that perhaps you don't even realize. Leveraging those dynamics properly, Priebatsch believes, can do everything from improve education to help solve global warming. 
For the moment, though, SCVNGR is focused on driving commerce. Let's say I'm walking down Mass. Ave. and open up the SCVNGR app on my smartphone. The app figures out where I am and displays all the nearby dining deals. B.Good, for instance, would pop up as one option, and, if I selected it, the app would display several games I could play there to earn points toward discounts and free stuff. Just checking in-announcing to other SCVNGR users that I'm at B.Good-earns me one point. Checking in while with another SCVNGR user gets me two. It goes deeper from there: If I locate an employee named Jimmy and take a picture with him, that's five points. Making up a name for a burger gets me two. Earning 25 total points earns me a free burger. If I want, I can even design my own games for other users to play. And if I'm doing that, then B.Good hopes it's got a new regular.
Major corporations and institutions also contract with SCVNGR to design custom games. Jewelry stores have partnered with the company to lead couples on races to find diamond rings hidden in cities. The U.S. Navy, Warner Bros., Coca-Cola, the Patriots, the Celtics, and MIT are among SCVNGR's 1,500-plus clients. The top ones pay the company $250,000 to $500,000 per year. (Full disclosure: This magazine's marketing department has a SCVNGR challenge. I've never played it and can't say whether it's any good.)
The SCVNGR app has been downloaded more than a million times, and Priebatsch reports that revenue is increasing at a rate of about 20 percent per month. Tom Hopcroft, president of the Mass Technology Leadership Council, a sort of chamber of commerce for the tech set, says that what Priebatsch is doing is "a really clever idea. I don't know if the gaming layer is the next big thing, but he's certainly a presence." 
Indeed, for all the business's promise, SCVNGR and its Chief Ninja face ever-larger problems. Ted Morgan is the CEO of Skyhook Wireless, a company that makes the technology by which mobile phones locate themselves. Skyhook is a third-party operative for many operators in the daily-deal tech sector. He says that for SCVNGR to really grow its business, it needs a large ad campaign. And it won't have that until "it has 5 to 10 million downloads." Complicating matters is the fate of the social-media/daily-deal sector itself. It is, many analysts believe, effectively sitting in the middle of an economic bubble. Umair Haque, director of the Havas Media Lab, wrote in the Harvard Business Review last year that any connection created over social media is weak and artificial, and not prone to prove a lasting relationship for either party. What's worse, the quickly converging daily-deal space is overloaded with industry leader Groupon; wannabes such as Gowalla, LivingSocial, BuyWithMe, and ScoutMob; and initial forays into the market by behemoths Facebook and Google. All of these companies are dying to cash in with deals that are likely too good to be true: A recent study from Rice University found that 32 percent of Groupon's vendors lost money and 40 percent of them said they wouldn't partner with Groupon again. Even investors in mighty Facebook dumped more than $1 billion in shares off the secondary market in April, for fear that the company, and the sector it spawned, is overvalued. The consensus in the tech world is that if and when the bubble bursts, only a few of the current players will survive. 
All of this uncertainty raises a very big question for SCVNGR: Can Seth Priebatsch, a guy who barely leaves the office and goes shopping only when he needs an orange T-shirt, get everyone else to spend their money the way he wants them to?
I'VE ACTUALLY KNOWN PRIEBATSCH for a long time. I was a classmate of his sister, Daniella, in middle school and high school, and Seth was just four years behind us. I rarely (if ever) spoke with him, but we spent two years on the same Noble and Greenough campus in Dedham. I remember three things about Priebatsch: He ran pretty much everywhere; because of this, everybody at the school knew who he was; and the older kids called him "Pip." (A former cross-country teammate of his explains: "We were looking for something that said young British chimney sweep." The subtleties of the English and South African accents were apparently lost on the group.) 
Pip was an excellent student at Nobles, perhaps because his parents had been pushing him hard ("encouraging" him, in their words) since birth. Norman, a biotech entrepreneur, says his son was reading by age three or four, and that he taught the youngster to read pages upside down as a challenge. Moving past the standard children's fare-which Norman found boring-the two tackled biographies, history, and other advanced subjects. Seth developed a particular fondness for the stories of Hannibal of Carthage and the French Revolution. In the Priebatsch household, TV was a no-no.
The family traveled extensively. There were trips to England, France, Italy, Israel, Spain, India, Japan, Thailand, and Australia, plus annual treks to Norman's native South Africa. On each journey, the children had to keep journals chronicling in "excruciating detail," as Priebatsch puts it, what they'd seen and done. "It was like 'Oh my God, I'm in Australia and instead of being on the beach, I'm doing  6 to 10 hours of writing.'" 
But in the Priebatsch family, good behavior brought rewards. "We had this cheesy star system," Priebatsch says, explaining how his parents awarded him credits for cleaning his room or doing homework, and yanked them away for fighting with his sister. "I lost a fair amount of stars that way," he says. When he earned enough, though, his parents gave him the money to buy a toy. From an early age, then, Priebatsch learned that game structure could be an effective way to influence behavior. His mother, Suzanne, a financial adviser at Smith Barney, used to take the kids to the Museum of Fine Arts. "And in order to keep them entertained, we did mini scavenger hunts," she says. 
So by the time Priebatsch got to Nobles, in seventh grade, he had an unconventional appreciation of the world. English teacher Richard Baker says that in his 40 years at the school, he's never taught anybody else quite like Priebatsch. "He's unique," Baker says, "in the sense of energy, in the sense of entrepreneurial interest and skill."
The problem was, Priebatsch knew that. Of some of his teachers he says: "Their domain expertise was weak at best. Their teaching style was acceptable but not exceptional by any means. And I'm sure I was difficult to them." 
Throughout high school, Priebatsch always seemed to be putting another business plan into action-and not all of them of the high-tech variety. Influenced by a story in the book Freakonomics in which a guy made a bundle selling bagels on the honor system, Priebatsch decided to open an "underground snack bar" at Nobles. First, he rented out three lockers in a prime location. "I would just hang out," he recalls, "and when people would open their locker I'd be like, 'Hey, you've got a really nice locker. If I give you 50 bucks, can I have your locker for the month?'" He then stocked them: One locker was for chips, another for candy, and the third was packed with ice for cold drinks. Next, he e-mailed the locker combos to his friends, telling them to just pay for what they took. He says he made $200 on the first day and $600 on the second. On the third he was called into the provost's office and told to shut it down.
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, Priebatsch headed off to Princeton. But he didn't stay long. The summer after he won the school's business-plan contest, a tech incubator in Philadelphia called DreamIt Ventures offered him office space and guidance-and $35,000-to come and further develop his plan. Michael Hagan, a veteran of two startups, worked at DreamIt as a strategist, helping young entrepreneurs find their way. He says that when Priebatsch first explained his vision for building a game layer on top of the world, "I thought it was so nuts-that it had such balls that you couldn't help but get excited about it." The two began working to grow SCVNGR, and by the end of the summer had reeled in about $80,000 in revenue. 
With the business doing well, Priebatsch decided to drop out of Princeton. This did not thrill his mother. Suzanne Priebatsch was walking down Newbury Street when she got the call from her son. "My instinct was to fall upon the ground and flail," she says, "but it was a rough sidewalk."
When the 19-year-old Priebatsch moved the company to his hometown of Boston, Hagan, a Philadelphia native then in his late twenties, followed. He became SCVNGR's "Chief Rockstar" (that's COO to the rest of us), and moved into Priebatsch's parents' house for a few months until he found a place of his own. That was not Norman and Suzanne's only contribution to the company: They plowed in $60,000 (still considerably cheaper than three more years of Princeton), making them two of their son's biggest early investors.
SCVNGR's big break came one Saturday morning in the fall of 2008, when Priebatsch received an e-mail from Peter Bell of Highland Capital. Highland, which has invested billions in companies over the years, is one of the most respected venture capital firms in the industry. Bell had read a story about SCVNGR on the website Mass High Tech and was so impressed that he did something he rarely does: cold-call an entrepreneur. It was as if a Red Sox scout had, without warning, suddenly showed up at a youth baseball game. 
Soon after, Priebatsch delivered a pitch to the Highland board at the company's Lexington headquarters. Highland eventually gave SCVNGR $750,000 in funding. In typical form, Priebatsch inserted a clause into the deal saying that the cash had to be delivered to him on a poster-size check, even bigger than the one he'd received from Princeton. This time, instead of jamming it into an ATM, he hung it up in the office.
By the end of its first fiscal year, SCVNGR had cleared more than $1 million in revenue. By its second year, Rich Miner-one of the men who invented Google's Android operating system-had invested $4 million of Google's money in SCVNGR. And by the end of its third year, 2010, the company had moved to Kendall Square-and had raised $15 million more in VC funding.
SCVNGR now employs 54 people, with plans this summer to add 60 more interns to help it scale up quickly. Each one will be armed, Hagan says, with the standard-issue Maverick REV-6 Nerf gun. That type of quirk, of course, is all part of the Priebatsch brand. It's the same reason he always wears orange and loves talking about lugging around 19 cell phones and the cacophony that erupts whenever he gets a call. (All the phones are so he can be certain the SCVNGR app is operating properly across all platforms.) He has merged himself and SCVNGR into a single, hyperenergetic entity. "There's an element of myth-building in Seth, in that while the things he says are true, there's also a sophisticated sense of image-building," says Baker, his high school English teacher. 
WHEN PRIEBATSCH TOOK THE STAGE for his South by Southwest keynote address, wearing his trademark shades, orange polo shirt, and jeans, expectations were high-because he'd raised them. "There's one thing that will blow everyone's mind," he had told the website Mashable.com before his speech. "The concept is brand new and if it works it will be one of the most epic things that has ever been done."
That thing was a game he'd designed for the audience of roughly 3,000. Each person was given a randomly colored sheet of paper. At the end of his speech, he instructed the crowd to trade sheets so that everyone in each row held the same color paper. If they could do it in less than two minutes, he'd donate $10,000 to the National Wildlife Foundation. The audience did it. Priebatsch was pumped: "That's freakin' awesome!" he exclaimed, going on about how the game illustrated that people who don't know one another can come together for a common purpose. The crowd was less excited: There was polite clapping and a few whoops, but the reaction seemed roughly that of a school group that had just been forced to play an educational game. 
Then again, maybe they were already in a skeptical frame of mind. Earlier in the speech, Priebatsch had argued that his game layer could be used to overcome such intractable problems as climate change and the nation's struggling schools. Games, he insisted, are the tools of a reformist revolution. And there lies the fundamental disconnect with Priebatsch. He talks with messianic fervor about how game mechanics can help solve the world's ills...but so far he's only offering cheap deals on burgers. 
And getting those cheap burgers isn't even any fun. I'm as ambivalent about the SCVNGR app as the crowd was about Priebatsch's paper-trading game. I'm just not inclined to go to a bar and pull out my phone to take a picture of my food, or take the time to answer inane questions, all in the name of getting two points toward a free drink. Other people seem to like it-the app's average rating at the iTunes store is three out of five stars-but I feel too self-conscious playing it. I wonder what that girl across the café or at the end of the bar would think of me going around like a doofus, trying to get my photo taken with an employee. Besides, many of the challenges on SCVNGR are very basic and, frankly, not that exciting. One game for the Toscanini's ice cream shop, for instance, just asks you what your favorite flavor is. Not exactly a brain-bender. You can almost feel yourself being manipulated by SCVNGR's partners. 
When I told Priebatsch I didn't really like the app, he understood my frustration. He could see how some people might not want to be playing a game all the time. "A large portion of people [who] were playing SCVNGR didn't quite get it," he said. 
He's recently launched another app, which debuted in Boston and Philadelphia, called LevelUp. It's designed to build customer loyalty in people like me, who aren't quite as into games. It works like this: Boloco, say, offers a deal where you get $10 worth of food for $5. Acting on that deal unlocks another in which you get $25 worth for $10. After taking advantage of that deal, you can get $45 worth for $15. I like LevelUp because, although it utilizes Priebatsch's game mechanics-the dual incentives of advancing levels and gaining rewards-it's not actually a game. It's a transaction. And one that Priebatsch thinks will work better for vendors than Groupon has. Groupon's partners complain not only that the site's deals don't always lead to repeat visits, but also that the company typically takes a 50 percent cut of every offering it does with a client. Priebatsch says LevelUp and its tiered system of deals builds customer loyalty, and provides a better arrangement for vendors: It takes no cut on the first level of deals, meaning SCVNGR gets paid only if customers return for the second- and third-level bargains. And rather than 50 percent, the SCVNGR take is 25 percent.
Boloco CEO John Pepper told me he's happy with SCVNGR and that he'd work with Priebatsch again. LevelUp also seemed to have its desired effect on me: After buying that first deal at Boloco, I found myself trying to convince a group of friends to go back so I could take advantage of the second-level deal. Priebatsch had won-I'd spent my money where he wanted me to.
It's still early, but "the age demographic for LevelUp is twice as broad as it is for SCVNGR," Priebatsch says. The male-to-female ratio, he adds, is much more balanced as well.
Whether it's burritos or the paper game from his keynote address, Priebatsch says he must start somewhere to realize his vision of changing the world. So he'll begin by flogging products; the do-gooderism is for later. "There's no way that the product that we've built to date maps up with the theory of what I'm talking about," he acknowledges. "It is a fraction of a shadow of what I think [the company] will be." If he can build the foundation for the game layer, he believes, then maybe he and others can start to use it as a tool to tackle bigger problems.
The point of all this seems to be that Priebatsch won't let his own ideas-even the ones that have made him a millionaire on paper-limit him. He's always looking for the next iteration of his vision, the next game. 
Already, LevelUp has evolved. SCVNGR recently announced a major partnership with American Express, allowing LevelUp deals to be linked directly to AmEx credit cards-meaning that to activate the increasing levels of their deals, users will no longer have to print out receipts or show their phone screens to the guy at the register. That's a smart idea that has so far escaped Priebatsch's competition. To survive, to be the one left standing when the bubble bursts, Priebatsch knows he must differentiate himself from rivals like Groupon, with its deep user base, and Foursquare, with its vaunted "mayor" status. Whatever the ultimate fate of SCVNGR, Highland Capital's Peter Bell makes it clear that he didn't invest in Priebatsch just because he liked the idea the company is built on. It was, Bell says, "frankly more a bet on Seth as an entrepreneur. The thesis was, This guy will do something very special."

 The End of Ownership 
After defining ourselves for generations by our possessionscars , houses , books, musica dramatic cultural shift is under way. In the wake of a collapsed economy and a warming planet , what matters to a growing number of Americans is not so much ownership as access . And that has made Boston ground zero for a powerful new force in modern life : the sharing economy.
By Janelle Nanos
Thelovely , light-filled room  leaped out at me from its online listing. Located in a historical adobe just outside the Plaza, in Santa Fe , the room was airy and bright , with a bed topped with a cozy blue -and-white quilt and a pair of burnt-orange pillows. A mint -green bookshelf lined with popular novels stood not far from a small nook containing an antique couch, on which I immediately imagined myself curling up into a ball and reading. Clicking around , I saw photos of other parts of the house: a private bathroom ; a small outdoor courtyard with flowering trees in full bloom; and a kitchen with multicolored Le Creuset pots and pans hanging on the walls. Katy , the woman who had posted the listing, looked kind . She had bright blue eyes and bangs that peeked out from under a knit hat. And, perhaps most important, she had a five -star rating . I could sleep there, I thought. So I booked .
How did I end up renting Katy's spare bedroom? I'd beeninvited to a wedding in Santa Fe , but the hotel where the guests were staying was expensive,and my budget was tight. So I decided to try out Airbnb , a website that allows you to rent rooms in private homes for less than what hotels and B & Bs charge . I logged on using my Facebook profile and was pleasantly surprised to find that friends of mine had already created accounts on the site . As I clicked through the listings , I was impressed by the photography, which looked like it could have been cribbed from the pages of Dwell. The booking engine was simple , and soon I was corresponding directly with Katy , who turned out to be friendly and welcoming. Later, as my husband and I were driving to her house, I texted her to say we were close by .Go on in ,  she wrote back .The door's unlocked . 
For the next few days , we came and went as we pleased. Katy left us organic eggs and Greek yogurt for breakfast. She offered suggestions about restaurants in town , and sites to visit in the area . Everything , in short, was just as lovely as advertisedand the whole experience got me thinking . We weren't just sleeping and vacationing at Katy's house. We were also taking part in a profound cultural shift in the way that a growing number of Americans are choosing to live their lives.
A startling number of young people , it turns out, have begun to question one of the central tenets of American culture: ownership. It's a change that has arrived thanks to a confluence of developments . Times are tough. For the first time , a rising generation of Americans are genuinely concerned that their standard of living will be worse than it was for the generation that came before them . Simultaneously , rapidly evolving technologies are enabling a new kind of connectedness and sharing, just as more of us than ever before are moving to urban areas. And more and more of us are at last awakening to the terrifying idea that our quintessentially American drive to own and consume more is bringing about dramatically harmful climate change . As a result , many of us are starting to rethink what it means to own something. In turn , that's giving rise to a new social and commercial landscape in this country, and even a new way of life . What we're witnessing , in short, is the emergence of the sharing economy.
The principle of ownership is fundamental in this countrypossession , after all, is nine -tenths of the law. It was more than a century ago that conspicuous consumption began to emerge as an animating component in American life , and by the time the 1950s rolled around and families started moving to the suburbs en masse, the accumulation of possessions (new appliances , bigger cars , fancier houses ) had become our default way of signifying success.Each home was to be its own fiefdom,  Douglas Rushkoff writes in Life , Inc. (2011 ) , describing the shift.Self -sufficiency was part of the myth of the self -made man in his private estate , so community property , carpools , or sharing of almost any kind became anathema to the suburban aesthetic. 
Corporate America saw opportunity in the rise of conspicuous consumption, of course . After developing a marketing technique calledperceived obsolescence ,  businesses began rolling out new versions of products that were somehow always better , faster , and smarter than the ones that had come before . The psychological effects were powerful , and they're still with us todayas anybody who has seen , or stood in , the lines outside of an Apple store before the release of a new iPhone can attest .
As Americans worked ever harder to own more , anything associated with common use and collective ownership came to be seen as undesirable and off-putting. Even in the late 1990s, when Robin Chase, the cofounder of Zipcar , did surveys on the streets of Boston in the run-up to the company's launch , respondents were recoiling at the mention of sharing.I needed to distance us from that as a concept,  she told me recently .Imagine if hotels were called bed-sharing. 
These days , though , growing numbers of Americans are coming around to the idea of sharing more and owning less . The 100Thing Challenge, a movement created by simple living advocate Dave Bruno, encourages people to whittle down their possessions to only 100items. (In April, he launched the Reduce Month campaign , prodding people to get rid of one item a day for a month or longer . ) Housing in some high -profile instanceslike themicro apartments  proposed for Boston's Innovation Districtis being reconfigured to accommodate smaller living spaces and fewer objects. Graham Hill , the Internet entrepreneur and poster boy for the minimalist -living movement , recently penned an op -ed in the New York Times about the spartan life he leads in his 420-square -foot apartment, where he owns six shirts , 10 bowls, and a collapsible table and bed. For weeks the piece occupied a place on the Times' most -emailed list .
New research is demonstrating the extent of this change in attitudes. A study released this February by the Pew Research Center found that thefinancial mileposts that have tended to define adulthood for generationsbuying a car or a homehave seen a dramatic shift in the wake of the recession. As of 2007 , two-fifths of Americans under the age of 35 owned their homes or apartments , but that number had dropped to one-third by 2011 . Today, only 66 percent of people age 25 and under own cars , a 7-percentage -point drop since 2007 . In 2001 , 50 percent of young adults under the age of 35 carried credit card debt , whereas only 39 percent of that same age group did in 2010 .
Some of this , of course , is a result of the economic downturn . But that's not the whole story. There's been a shift in mindset as well . The rise of social media has helped change the perceived cultural value of sharing.Facebook rebranded it ,  Chase says , noting the power of the company'sShare this  button . And according to Henry Mason, the global head of research at the consumer -tracking network Trendwatching.com, young people are increasingly forgoing thehassles of ownership.  What they care most about these days , it seems, is not ownership but access .
Airbnb got its start in the fall of 2008 . Its founders , Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia , had recently graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and were scraping by in San Francisco, barely able to pay their rent . When an industrial -design conference came to town , they realized they might be able make some extra money by taking in a few boarders who were coming to the conference but didn't want to shell out for an expensive hotel. So they built a website, bought some air mattresses , and wound up playing host to three people for the weekend.
Today, Airbnb has become an international phenomenon , with more than 12 million room -sharing bookings as of 2012 . A booking is now made every two seconds on the site , and more than 650Boston listings have been added just in the past year . Industry analysts estimate that in time the company could be valued at $1billion. That's a lot of air mattresses .
Chesky and Gebbia were at the vanguard of the emerging sharing economy, in which peer -to -peer exchanges of goods and services are now hailed as a more economical , ecological , and social form of ownership. Scores of new online marketplaces are cropping up every week , most of which charge a nominal fee to broker the exchange of goods and services between strangers. Forbes estimates that the revenue generated from these exchanges will surpass $3.5billion in 2013 . Time called collaborative consumption one of the10 Ideas That Will Change the World.  And in March, The Economist devoted a cover story to the subject. People are starting to pay attention, and for good reason .
Consider the company started by Shelby Clark, who moved from San Francisco to Cambridge in 2008 to attend Harvard Business School . Clark got rid of his car during the move , relying on public transportation and Zipcar to get around town . But on one particularly awful winter day he discovered that the nearest Zipcar was two and a half miles away , near Inman Square . As he trudged over to it , with the elements assaulting him from every angle, he noticed dozens of cars covered in snow that hadn't been driven in weeks. Suddenly , he had an idea . If people were already comfortable with the sharing concept of a company like Zipcar , he thought, perhaps they'd be willing to actually share their own cars . So in 2010 he launched RelayRides , a national peer -to -peer car-sharing service that has raised $13 million to date from Google Ventures and General Motors Ventures , and that announced a partnership with GM last March.
These days , people canmonetize  much more than just empty bedrooms and idle cars in driveways. Driveways themselves are up for grabs, thanks to ParkatmyHouse. A site called Zimride has given digital form to the old college ride -sharing board, allowing you to earn cash by taking passengers with you on long road trips. Then there's SideCar, an app that transforms everyday drivers into de facto cabbies, by allowing users to hail them with their mobile phones . Ride a bike instead? You can rent one by the day on Spinlister . And if you're like the average owner of a power tool , who uses it for a lifetime maximum of just 13 minutes, you can put that drill or jigsaw up on NeighborGoods and let the folks next door rent it .
All of these websites and apps are up and running in the Boston area , and countless others are springing up in cities around the country. It's safe to say, in fact , that if you look around your home right now and can identify at least one possession that you haven't used in at least a week , someone out there is building a platform to help you share it . And that doesn't even include the intangible assets that we all possess: our time , our interests, and our abilities. Animal lovers can find (or become ) dog sitters through DogVacay . A site called Vayable enables people to play tour guide to visitors traveling to their city . And TaskRabbit and Skillshare allow people to commoditize their own resourcefulness.
Add it all up , and you've got a reconfiguration of how we seeand sellour value in life .Whether you're a business or an individual ,  says Lisa Gansky , the author of The Mesh : Why the Future of Business Is Sharing (2010 ) ,chances are that you spent some amount of time since 2008 realigning the true cost of things with their true value. So for many of us , we looked around our homes, or our factories, or our offices, and we realized that a lot of things that we collected or we owned, we didn't necessarily use well , or appreciate , or get value from . 
The sharing industry's cheerleaders tout the financial and environmental benefits that the peer -to -peer economy creates, like the fact that Airbnb travelers in San Francisco contributed $56 million to the city's economy last year . More important, they claim that forgoing ownership means that you're tapping into an enlightened network of like -minded individuals who share your values .You know how Cracker Jack has the surprise inside ?  Gansky says .The sharing economy has the surprise inside , too. Most people start doing one of the services because it's financially sensible . But the surprise inside is that , after we experience these things , we actually tend to realize that we kind of like the connection with people . And it feels really intimate , and there's a kind of serendipity that happens. 
When Derek Fraser first entered the sharing economy in 2011 , he wasn't looking for serendipity. Like many who were faced with new financial realities when the economy bottomed out, he had turned to sharing because it was necessary. In 2009 , at the age of 26 , he had been laid off from a teaching job and had begun collecting unemployment . Adding to his financial challenge was the fact that his wife , Pamela , had just gone back to school . The couple sold one of their cars to cut down on expenses , and Derek took some part -time work . But then his unemployment ran out.It was so bad,  he says .It was not something I expected , and I was disheartened . 
Then one day he noticed a flyer in the Davis Square T station promoting RelayRides . Is this for real ? he wondered , and looked it up online .It seemed legit, like a startup company,  he says .It didn't seem like a scam .  Already familiar with the concept of car sharing through Zipcar (which is often called the gateway to the sharing economy) , he decided to give it a try. He and Pamela put their Prius up on the site , and within hours had received a request from a driver .
Today, they're regular users. Derek gets a text message every time a driver wants to rent his car. After checking with Pamela about their schedule , he looks at the driver's online profile, and if the person seems okay , he gives the transaction the go -ahead. From there, the driver uses a smartphone app to unlock the vehicle, with the keys waiting for him inside . The driver gets to use the car for the agreed -upon window of time and is expected to return it to the same parking spot , with the gas tank refilled . The driver's credit card is charged through RelayRides , and Derek can negotiate additional fees if the car comes back late , is messy, or has gone over the mileage they'd agreed upon beforehand . If the driver damages the car, Derek can file a complaint with RelayRides , which will cover the cost of repairs and give him $30 a day until his car is fixed. Derek is paid a few times a month, and RelayRides takes 25 percent of each rental fee as commission .
The Frasers earned $120from their first rental , and have now rented out their car nearly 100times. (According to Shelby Clark, of RelayRides , the average user earns about $250a month. ) They credit the site with helping them stay afloat through Derek's period of unemployment . And in the summer , when things get busiest, they make enough to cover their monthly car payment.
Almost everybody I spoke to for this story said that , like Derek Fraser , they first became a part of the sharing movement for economic reasons. In the process, they had to get over what I've come to think of as the Ick Factor : an aversion to sharing that's rooted in the fear of strangers, germs, and awkward social encounters . Think of all those lessons our parents taught us : Don't talk to strangers. Never get in a car with someone you don't know . If you want to take part in the sharing economy, you somehow have to push aside your mother's voice in your head and develop a sense of trust.
That was certainly the case for Fraser and his wife . Who were these drivers? What would happen if someone crashed his car or , worse, just took off with it ? Was there insurance? Clark worked on this problem for months before officially launching the business .Insurance companies are by definition risk averse ,  he says .If you're a pioneer, it's very difficult.  In the end, though , after some haggling , he got what he needed . All cars in RelayRides' network are covered for up to $1million in damages, and all renters' driving records are screened before they can check out a car. (Insurance companies, meanwhile, are eyeing these peer -to -peer exchanges warily , and some have changed their policies so as not to cover car-sharing accidents. )
For Airbnb , the push to earn users' trust involves verifying the credit card , phone number , and address of all prospective renters before allowing them to post listings on the site .We've really cleaned it up and brought it above board compared with the Wild West of Craigslist ,  says Molly Turner , the company's public policy director . The site also often pulls in information from Facebook , so that when you look for a room in , say, Paris, it will identify its users who also exist in your extended network, which can provide an extra layer of assurance. When I logged on to the site recently , I found rooms offered by people who went to my high school , and rooms in the homes of friends of friends.
Most peer -to -peer sites now also allow users to rate their experience . In the past , reviews were a one-way street . Only customers wrote themabout, say, hotels or restaurants. But in the sharing economy, the process works both ways . You can rate an owner on Airbnb , just as you would a hotel, but now they can also rate youas a five -star house guest, maybe, or as a slob who left Cheetos crumbs all over the couch. Increasingly , these reviews will attach themselves to your online persona. Experts predict they'll become a kind of currency , which you can then use in future transactions . Already, a company called Virtrue is trying to carve out a piece of this people -ranking market , by syncing up ratings from peer -to -peer sharing sites with personal information pulled from LinkedIn and Facebook . It's like Yelp , but for humans .
As these businesses evolve , plenty of people are now entering the sharing economy to make money rather than connections. Scrolling through Airbnb's Boston listings recently , I found one user offering a half -dozen properties . Some people on RelayRides have bought second and third cars just to earn more from the site , which runs counter to the company'sfewer cars on the road  sensibility. (It likes to say that one car shared through its site takes 14 others off the road . )
But as these micro entrepreneurs get increasingly savvy, they , along with the sites they're using, have come under scrutiny from municipal officials. One person who thinks about such challenges is Nigel Jacob, Mayor Menino's adviser on emerging technologies and the cochair of the city's office of New Urban Mechanics. He's met with several sharing startups to learn how they operate, and has been in touch with leaders in other cities to see how they ensure public safety .
He's had a lot to absorb . Right now in New York City , many Airbnb hosts are finding that they're violating laws governing short-term rentals in large buildings. The New York Times recently ran a story about one unlucky host who, after charging a Russian tourist $300to stay in his apartment while he was away , was threatened with $40 ,000in fines by the city for running an illegal hotel. In 2011 , the most recent year for which records are available, New York investigated 1,897such violations . Last year in San Francisco, meanwhile, two peer -to -peer shuttle services , SideCar and Lyft , were each issued a cease-and-desist order by the city and fined $20 ,000for operating outside of the formal taxi -and-limousine permitting process. (San Francisco lifted the order in January, saying it needed to revisit the regulations. ) And just as crowds started flooding into Austin , Texas, this past March for the annual South by Southwest conference , the city council there passed a law that made charging for ride -sharing a crime.
It's understandable that cities want to regulate these new businesses , but their early attempts have been less than effective.A lot of times you end up with regulators stopping things because they run afoul of existing regulations, or allegedly do , and not necessarily because they're bad for the public interest ,  says Nick Grossman , a visiting scholar with the MIT Center for Civic Media.
There's no obvious place to put the sharing economy within the existing legal framework,  says Janelle Orsi , an Oakland, Californiabased attorney who directs the Sustainable Economies Law Center . Orsi says that when she first began working on what she callssharing law,  she expected that she would be helping nonprofits or cooperatives , not overseeing peer -to -peer transactions . Sharing as commerce , she says ,brings up so many other legal issues . 
The good news for Boston , Nigel Jacob says , is that City Hall hasn't yet felt the need to muck things up with regulation .There's a lot of fascinating activity around sharing as a new mode of collaboration and economic expression ,  he told me .The issue for us is , which side do we put ourselves on ? Do we regulate or do we not? We try to use the regulatory aspect of government sparingly, as it often can backfire .  The city is looking to foster innovation , he says , and cracking down on these startups would run counter to that .
Plus , he has a personal interest in seeing these kinds of companies succeed. He's just listed his own place on Airbnb .
Jacob is a step ahead of me . Although I'm excited about the ways in which the sharing economy could improve my own life (think of the cash ! ) , I have to admit I haven't completely overcome the Ick Factor . After my great experience in Santa Fe , I filled out a listing for my home on Airbnbbut have yet to take the plunge and turn it on . I've added my car to the RelayRides network, but the first query I received was from a guy who wanted to rent my car for a week , which made me panic and turn him down .
To better understand , and perhaps overcome , my aversions, I went to see Juliet Schor, an economist who teaches sociology at Boston College. Schor is the author of True Wealth (2010 ) , a book that offers suggestions for rethinking what's valuable in our lives.In order for our economy to survive, and for humans to survive and thrive in the current very perilous ecological context that we find ourselves in ,  she told me ,we need more structures that encourage cooperation and sharing.  Like others I spoke to for this story, she noted that sharing itself isn't new, particularly among low-income communities. But, she added, it certainly is a new concept for those with high cultural capital, people who don't need to share, that is , but increasingly want to . Schor assured me that I'm not the only one feeling slightly unnerved by the prospect of sharing my possessions with strangers, or of paying people to use their stuff in the hopes of creating aconnection . 
Schor was wearing a shawl as we spoke, and at that point in the conversation she pulled her hands out from under it : One hand represented a friend , she said , and the other a business . She then used both hands to draw a box in the air between them .So these sharing sites and practices are, I think, creating a third kind of intermediate zone , in which it's all being worked out and invented . And as people are moving there, they struggle with things : Well , how much market should there be ? How high should my standards be ? Should I expect professional quality? 
That zone is where most of us now reside .
In her research , Schor explained, she's finding that her subjects are increasingly eager to work outside the standard , business -as -usual marketplaces . Call it bailout hangover . But even with the trust-building exercises that these new sharing companies walk users through, people are still not exactly comfortableor clear on how to navigate once they're in the system .People don't expect the same kind of relationship that they do [in ] going to the market and buying the service from a professional ,  Schor said .But it's also different from what they would just do with a friend . 
Schor pointed me to the work of Anny Fenton , a Harvard graduate student whose research looks at how people are operating within the sharing economy. In a recent paper, Fenton studied social interactions among RelayRides users. Her findings are fascinating. Despite all of the talk about community and connection that we're hearing from advocates of the sharing economy, car owners using the site said that their relationships with renters weresterile,  anonymous andnothing.  But when those same owners were asked to compare their rental service with that offered by a company like Hertz, time and again they said they had something much more personal to offer, and assumed, as a result , that renters would treat their cars better than a typical rental car.Owners create a contradiction as they transform their personal property into a commodity,  Fenton wrote,but do not expect it to be treated like one. 
When I asked Fenton about her own experiences making peer -to -peer exchanges, she laughed. She'd stayed in an apartment in Paris with a host who was drawing most of his income from Airbnb , and though she'd stayed in B & Bs many times before , this experience struck her as very different, so much so that she behaved differently. One night her host invited her to dinnerand she went . Throughout the meal , he regaled her with stories of his past relationships and ended up paying .It's cheaper than therapy,  he told her.
Was she a friend ? A customer ? She left puzzled by the exchange , but says it captured the inherent tension that underlies so much of the sharing economy: Are we actually making more connections? Or are we just commoditizing our relationships?
When I posed this question to MIT's Nick Grossman , he sat back in his chair and nodded .But there's another kind of social stickiness that these networks can help overcome ,  he said ,which is just the awkwardness of broaching a conversation .  In many instances, it's not the act of sharing itself that's difficult, it's the social aspect of having to make the ask, whether it's borrowing your neighbor's snowblower , crashing on your old college roommate's couch, or asking your circle of friends to help you move .Those conversations are a little bit hard to broker ,  he says .It's not the Ick Factor , as in , You're sitting in my car. You're sitting in my house. It's more like , How do we even have the conversation about my borrowing your snowblower ? 
It's becoming easy to see how, in circumstances where people feel strange about asking for favors from their friends or neighbors, they'll turn to the marketplace instead. We say we're getting into the sharing economy to build community, but you have to wonder whether it's also a way to avoid engaging with the community we already have .
Rachel Botsman, the coauthor of What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption (2010 ) , has calculated the value of the peer -to -peer rental market to be $26 billion, and Forbes anticipates that the market will grow 25 percent more in the coming year . Big corporations increasingly want in , so much so that there's now a VC firm , Collaborative Fund , that's dedicated to investing in sharing-based startups .
This weighs on some of those who are actually participating in these marketplaces at the individual level. A bit of a backlash has even begun.Sharing for ProfitI'm Not Buying it Anymore was the title of a recent post on Shareable, an online magazine which until now has been one of the most vocal proponents of the sharing economy. In it the author , Sven Eberlein , writes ,What once used to be the most basic human value your parents ever taught yousharingseems to have magically morphed into a well coiffed, profitable , and fashionably cool buzzword for an entire industry . 
Janelle Orsi , the sharing lawyer , has similar feelings .I'm disappointed in the structure and the financing of most sharing-economy companies,  she says .Because they're mostly VC -funded , there's a great deal of incentive for their founders , and for their funders, to sell out to a larger company.  It's happened already: Avis recently bought Zipcar for $500million. So it's not all that far-fetched to imagine that Airbnb could one day be purchased by , say, Marriott .And when that happens,  Orsi says ,it means that the key platforms of the sharing economy will be increasingly consolidated under the ownership of richer and richer people . Which is ironic . 
As sharing sites increase in popularity , however, Schor anticipates that they'll begin to fragment and become more targeted to specialized audiences. More nonprofit options, meanwhile, may arise to serve those users who are turned off by the idea of sharing for cash . All of this makes her feel cautiously optimistic . Commerce and the desire to make money, she thinks , don't have to be the sole drivers of the sharing economy.
It's been over a year since my stay in Santa Fe , and in that time , I've noticed a bit of rewiring in terms of the way my brain thinks about ownership. As I talk about sharing with my friends and colleagues , I've felt an untightening of the gripboth physical and mentalthat I've held on my possessions. Even my own mother , who instilled the stranger - danger sentiments in me , keeps asking me if I've listed my place yet on Airbnb . I still haven't. But, like Schor, I'm optimistic . I've found that the rise of the sharing economy, and the difficult questions it has forced me to confront , have made me reevaluate all that I own. I find myself thinking , Do I use this enough ? Can it help someone else ? as I sort through my possessions. I've also become less inclined to make purchases without thinking about whether I can just share something instead. More important, as I've signed up to explore dozens of sharing sites, I've begun to realize that I can own much less .
As for the Ick Factor ? I'm doing my best to get over it . I may not become a homespun hotelier any time soon , but I've been snapping photos of my housewares and am open to sharing them . And if you're looking to rent a Jeep , there's a lovely one parked just outside my house.

The 50 Most Powerful Women in Boston
In more ways and fields than ever, they're stepping up and taking the reins in the Hub: Meet the players who pull the strings around here. 
Edited by Alexandra Hall 
With reporting by Shannon Fischer  
CAROLYN LYNCH KNOWS how to to play her cards right at a man's game.
A legend in philanthropy circles, she also just happens to have won three national bridge tournaments, despite often being one of the few women in the competition. Bain & Company chairman Orit Gadiesh has, as the only woman in a room full of execs, been known to drop four-letter words to break the ice. Communications honcho Micho Spring has taken dives-of the literal scuba variety-simply because, on an otherwise all-male team of business partners, "I'd be damned if I was going to be left behind."
Shrinking violets, these ladies are not. So as we pause to consider what power means to women in Boston these days, let's dispense with all those stale You've come a long way, baby patronizations. Ditto But you've still got a long way to go.
Because somewhere in between those two clichés, women and power in Boston have formed a far more complex relationship. For starters, the term "powerful women" is no longer an oxymoron (nor is it-and hallelujah, already-confined anymore to E! specials about Madonna). You might even say there's no longer a need for the term-the idea of women in power is now so commonplace, we barely even think about it. In Boston, women are regularly flexing their muscles in the city's traditional power buckets. We're talking about politics (hello, Therese Murray, Martha Coakley, and Vicki Kennedy, not to mention the columnist who unflinchingly covers their field, Joan Vennochi); law (give it up for Cheryl Cronin, one of President Obama's trusted legal consultants, and attorney Regina Pisa, who guides many of our biggest companies through their mergers and acquisitions); and business (for starters, TJX savior Carol Meyrowitz, and Gloria Larson, the president of Bentley University, who also brought us the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center-on time and on budget). Nowadays, a powerful woman is simply a given.
And yet, look a little closer at the methods by which Boston women have acquired power. Some of our biggest female players (paging Barbara Lynch, who's proven that sometimes the best place for a woman really is in the kitchen-but running an empire of restaurants) have positioned themselves to control wide swaths of our city. (Snaps, please, for Susan Hockfield and Drew Gilpin Faust, presidents of MIT and Harvard, respectively, for winning posts unimaginable for women even a decade ago-and to Larry Summers half a decade ago.) These ladies pull the formal civic strings, and shape how people think and live everywhere around us. They've seized power in terrifically diverse ways...which forced us, as we created this list of Boston's 50 Most Powerful Women, to reconsider the very notion of power itself.
What we found was that women have often attained influence by scrappier methods than the so-called stronger sex-if only because they've had more obstacles placed in front of them and thus have had to take more creative paths, being more patient, efficient, and funny along the way. Take Gadiesh: Years ago, when she was advising a steel company, the CFO waffled about taking her on tours of factories because women were considered "bad luck." Rather than taking offense, she took care of business, defusing the situation with a quip. "In that case," she said, "I think that you should make sure I tour every single one of your competitors." Today she runs Bain.
Of course, gumption has never been exclusive to X chromosomers; self-made women and men have always had to exhibit just that kind of creativity and tenacity-and arguably need to do so now more than ever in this brave new economy of ours. But lest we forget: The women perched at the top of their field today would have started at the bottom just a couple of generations ago, when, to put it lightly, the way wasn't nearly so paved. In fact, most of the women who made our list this year were pavers themselves, which means they've witnessed enormous changes in just the span of their career. "It used to be that if the woman in the room had a good idea, it was attributed to the guy sitting next to her," recalls Micho Spring. "Now, there are lots of women in the room. And most of the time one of them is leading the brainstorm."
It's true, of course, that some of the women who now run our town originally had power handed to them-be it by a husband or a father. (Fidelity's Abigail Johnson, for instance, or Barbara Lee, Carolyn Lynch, Barbara Hostetter, Vicki Kennedy, and Linda Pizzuti Henry). No question, there's an argument that having power without having earned it on your own isn't really having power at all. But without inherited power, where would any of the Rockefellers, Waltons, Bushes, Kerrys, or countless other accomplished Americans be? What matters isn't that someone got handed something; what matters is what that person did with it. And the women on our list who had power passed to them have done plenty with it. Rather than merely using their windfall as a personal stimulus package-more David Yurman, more facelifts, more lightweight, social-column-friendly flails at "philanthropy"-they've displayed genuine chutzpah in creating something visionary, and quite individual, with the opportunities they've been given. 
They, just like their colleagues who've constructed their power base from the ground up, have been every bit as resilient and tough as men. In some ways, even more so. Chalk it up to different testosterone/estrogen levels, if you like. Or different cultural expectations. Or both. But according to a slew of recent research, women generally prove more predisposed to multitasking and to more-diplomatic management. "In the boardroom, guys usually want to win the argument, but women want to end it," says Spring. "Lots of times, the victory isn't in winning; it's just in moving on."
We all know about the challenges: Massachusetts may be consistently ranked among the 10 best states for working women, but our wage gap still exists. (Though that might not be true for much longer; women may not out-earn men when it comes to money, but as of last year, they do so in Ph.D's.) And while thankfully more dads are digging into parenting these days, moms still find themselves on the hook for most of the child-rearing and housework, even though they increasingly bring in half the money. That disparity eats into the ability of even the most talented mom to get ahead at the office. Which means that until duties on the "second shift" even out, the glass ceiling will remain intact-even if there are a million cracks in it.  
But these roadblocks are, frankly, what make the women on our list all the more remarkable. They've managed to create the life balance they needed to advance-displaying nothing less than fearlessness.
Fearless. That was, perhaps, our most bandied-about watchword as we argued over and compiled this list. After all, it's a bit of a misnomer. Bravery doesn't mean the absence of fear. It means being afraid-and then powering through, anyway. Though there continue to be obstacles casting a long shadow over women's attempts at professional success, the ladies on our list have pushed on with guts and smarts, innovation and creativity-and now cast their own very long shadows over our city.

Power demo:  If it seems like Bank of America is taking over the world, it's Anne Finucane's job to make it feel like a friendly takeover, with easy access to ATMs and online checking for all. She may have gotten her start at Hill Holliday, but these days she does lots more than just plan advertising strategy-she also oversees B of A's government affairs and public policy work. She rode herd on the bank's efforts to pay back its TARP money and is a key contact for Congress and the Obama administration. And just to make sure we locals didn't forget about her, she was front and center last summer when Ken Burns released his baseball documentary The Tenth Inning, positioning B of A as its primary sponsor. Her husband, Mike Barnicle, had a starring role in the doc, by the way. Did we mention Finucane is powerful?-Jason Schwartz

ANNE HAWLEY
DIRECTOR, THE ISABELLA STEWART GARDNER MUSEUM 
Hawley began at the Gardner more than 20 years ago with a bang-just before thieves walked off with $500 million in fine art. She'll kick off 2012 with a different sort of excitement: the unveiling of the museum's Renzo Pianoâ "designed wing, a $114 million modern wonder featuring a 300-seat performance hall, a 2,000-square-foot special exhibition gallery, even an adjoining greenhouse area. The project tested Hawley's considerable skills, given that the founder of the museum had written it into her will that the collections must never be modified. Hawley not only needed to convince the Supreme Judicial Court that the expansion wouldn't change the original building or its contents-she also had to overcome the objections of disapproving neighborhood preservationists.-Brittany Jasnoff

It's too bad that every time Carol Johnson's name turns up in the paper these days, somebody seems to be criticizing her. She's been forced to institute budget-trimming initiatives such as closing or merging more than a dozen schools, and she's set about firing or reassigning underperforming teachers-hardly a recipe for positive PR. Still, Johnson has been taking care of business since arriving from Memphis in 2007: The city's test scores are up, the dropout rate is at its lowest point in two decades, and BPS was named one of the 20 most-improved school systems in the world in a 2010 McKinsey & Co. report.-Tanya Pai

VICTORIA REGGIE KENNEDY
FORMER PARTNER, KECK, MAHIN & CATE  
She's known to most as the late Ted Kennedy's wife. But Vicki Kennedy has quickly become a major force in local and national political circles. After the senator's passing, it's said that her support helped install longtime aide Paul Kirk to keep the seat warm until-much to her chagrin-it was captured by Scott Brown. And over the last year, she's become a sought-after endorsement, stumping for several Democratic candidates in November and working the social circuit with gusto. She's popped up at benefits and openings galore, and has delivered multiple high school and college commencement addresses-all in addition to one of her biggest charitable endeavors, fundraising for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate. Though the former lawyer found herself on many Dems' shortlists of potential challengers to Brown in 2012, she's wound up brushing off speculation regarding a future candidacy-for now, anyway.-Donna Garlough

Under Loux, Local 26 has doubled its membership and become one of New England's largest private-sector unions, and the percentage of Boston's unionized hotels has shot up from 40 to 60. Loux comes by her trade naturally-her mother was the hotel waitress who took on the all-male bartenders union and got it to admit women.-Alexandra Hall

JOAN VENNOCHI
COLUMNIST, BOSTON GLOBE 
There are just a handful of local scribes we truly rely on to offer actual perspective about the state of our city (the rest seem to exist purely to be made fun of). Among the serious few, none uses her Globe-given soapbox to more provocative effect than op-ed writer Joan Vennochi, who'll take on-and take down-anything from the casino bill to high school bullies to the politics of snow removal. More important, her judgments frequently translate to results. Last November, for example, she blasted the idea that Marty Meehan, a former congressman who now runs UMass Lowell, was being taken seriously as a candidate for UMass president. Just days later, Meehan removed himself from contention for the spot. Coincidence? Quite doubtful.-Donna Garlough

WOMEN AND MONEY
First the good news: Some of the most powerful women in the entire business world are right here in Boston. Orit Gadiesh is chairman of one of the nation's most commanding consulting firms, Bain & Company; Abigail Johnson is the possible heir to financial giant Fidelity Investments; Laura Sen runs discount powerhouse BJ's Wholesale Club; and entrepreneur Robin Chase, cofounder and former CEO of Zipcar, is dramatically changing how we think about transportation.
The other good news? If you're single, female, college-educated, have no kids, and hold a full-time job, then there's a very good chance you make more money than your male peers. Boston is one of the few cities where women have a real shot at earning even more than men with similar experience and education. Moreover, our universities turn out groundbreaking minds in medicine, science, marketing, and more, and many of those women stay in Boston after graduating.
The bad news, though, is pretty bad: Despite the concentration of female talent, and the high level of female participation in the workforce, women still hold just 8.9 percent of executive roles in our state's 100 largest public companies-a number that's actually lower than both the all-time Massachusetts high of 9.2 percent (set in 2003) and the 13.5 percent at all Fortune 500 companies in 2009. So while the women who have broken through are mighty examples indeed, it's fair to say that on the whole we still have our work cut out for us.-Kris Frieswick
8.9: Percentage of women in executive roles in our state's 100 largest public companies.
13.5: Percentage of women in executive roles at all Fortune 500 companies in 2009.
WOMEN AND SCHOOLS 
High-ranking job posts in education have mostly belonged to men. But between 1986 and 2006, the percentage of female presidents in higher education more than doubled, from 9.5 to 23, thanks in no small part to some of the Hub's most brilliant women. Start with Susan Hockfield, the neuroscientist chosen in 2004 as MIT's first female president. Then there's Drew Gilpin Faust, named Harvard's first female president-an arguably poetic replacement for Larry Summers, who, of course, once said that the reason women aren't well represented in the sciences was possibly "intrinsic aptitude" differences between the sexes. 
Meanwhile, outside the ivory tower, Boston Public Schools superintendent Carol Johnson is one of the biggest decision-makers when it comes to our kids' futures. Since taking over in 2007, she's delivered an aggressive five-year plan to better prep students for graduation and college and improve relations among schools and neighborhood groups. And faced with a $63 million shortfall last year, she made the tough, controversial choice to close nine schools in order to prevent drastic program cuts across the entire district.-Anne Vickman
23: Percentage of female presidents in higher education in 2006, more than double from 1986.
WOMEN AND RESTAURANTS
Boston has a longstanding national reputation as a place where women chefs and restaurateurs can get ahead. Last November, Esquire's tribute to "The Female Universe of Culinary Bostonians" spotlighted local food pros such as Jody Adams of Rialto; Lydia Shire of Towne and Scampo; Oleana's Ana Sortun; restaurateur Michela Larson; and dining-scene empress Barbara Lynch. 
But what's even more impressive than that lineup is that a new generation of women chefs are following in their footsteps-and becoming stars in their own right. Joanne Chang, once hired by Adams to whip up pastries at Rialto, is owner of three Flour bakery/cafés, and co-owner of Myers+Chang restaurant. The first printing of her new cookbook, Flour, sold out in two months. Tiffani Faison, hired by Larson at the South End's Rocca, has appeared on two seasons of Top Chef and, now that Rocca has closed, is setting her sights on a solo venture. 
So what is it, exactly, that makes our city so friendly to female chefs? Part of it is self-perpetuating. With so many women in the field, notes Sortun, up-and-comers don't have to look far for role models. (She's currently helping to catapult pastry chef Maura Kilpatrick, with whom she opened Sofra Bakery and Café.) 
Newcomers, too, have benefited from that support system. Chef Patricia Yeo, who arrived in Boston in 2009 to helm the now-closed Ginger Park, notes that a chef's gender isn't a defining trait here. "In New York, there was only a handful of female chefs, so whenever anyone was writing a story on chefs and needed a token woman to include, you'd get a call," she recalls. "It's a different story here."-Donna Garlough
WOMEN AND PHILANTHROPY
Income and education levels are the biggest determinants when it comes to philanthropy. So it only makes sense that in a city filled with smart and high-earning women, ladies here have huge philanthropic profiles. 
Take Barbara Hostetter: She's president of both the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum board of trustees and the Barr Foundation, which last year alone gave $50 million to help fight climate change. Then there's Carolyn Lynch, whose passion for education is literally written all over Emmanuel College and Boston College-both of which have buildings bearing her name. Myra Kraft, wife of Patriots owner Robert Kraft, directs funds from her family's personal foundation and the New England Patriots Charitable Foundation to community efforts like afterschool sports programs for children. Since creating the White House Project years ago, millionaire do-gooder Barbara Lee has helped groom countless female political candidates to run for office.
Which brings us to this: Studies show that women are twice as likely as men to discuss charitable giving with their children. Meaning that in addition to everything else they do, they're also readying the next generation of philanthropists.  -TANYA PAI

WOMEN AND GOVERNMENT 
Someone who got all her news from TV could be excused for thinking that women were making major strides toward equality in elected politics. Sadly, the increasing visibility of political women (Christine O'Donnell, Sarah Palin, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, Nancy Pelosi) doesn't actually point to any great strides in gender equality in this arena, especially around here. 
In January the number of women in the 160-member Massachusetts House fell from 40 to 36, and the number in the 40-member Senate dropped from 12 to 11, according to data compiled by the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts Boston. In addition, there have been only six women in the history of the commonwealth elected to statewide constitutional office, including newly elected state Auditor Suzanne Bump; Martha Coakley (attorney general); Kerry Healey (lieutenant governor); Jane Swift (lieutenant governor, and later acting governor); Shannon O'Brien (treasurer); and Evelyn Murphy (lieutenant governor). Therese Murray now sits as Senate president, which is indeed a powerful role but isn't an elected position. Although women represent about half of the population of the state, they hold only 20.6 percent of the municipal governance positions here, based on data from 2007. 
Part of the problem may be women's unwillingness to run: According to a study done by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, women have to be asked an average of seven times before they will agree to run for public office. Men need be asked only once, if at all.-K.F.

Would You Let This Man Go Free?
Asateenager, Greg Diatchenko was convicted of murder and given the mandatory sentence: life without parole. Now science, and the courts, could give him another chance.
By Beth Schwartzapfel
Wearingacrisply pressed blue button-down and jeans, Greg Diatchenko could beasuburban dad arriving foraparent-teacher conference. The 50-year-old murderer walks intoasunny conference room at the medium-security state prison in Norfolk, his cheeks freshly shaven, his glasses silver, his eyes blue-green. It'sawarm day in April, and he awkwardly scans to the scrum of people waiting there for him--the prison's press director,acorrectional officer, his lawyer, me--to figure out where to sit. When he shakes my hand, his palms are callused, his fingernails trimmed to the quick.Iknow he's nervous, because his lawyer told me. But he just seems thoughtful, reflective, sincere. 
Diatchenko's lawyer has serious reservations about his speaking withajournalist. But Diatchenko hopes his story can help the other62Massachusetts inmates who, like him, were sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed when they were still too young to vote. His lawyer sits in on our 90-minute conversation, occasionally shutting down certain avenues of questioning, and Diatchenko heeds his advice not to talk about the brutal crime that landed him in here.
He learned to listen to his lawyer the hard way: Thirty-three years ago, asateenager, Diatchenko took the advice of his drinking buddies instead of his attorney. He'd been caught stabbingaman to death, and in the run-up to his trial, the prosecutor made him an offer: plead guilty to second-degree murder and avoid the almost-certain conviction at trial of first-degree murder. Given the strength of the evidence against him, it was likeagift. But Diatchenko, stupid and 17, turned it down. You can do better than that, his friends told him.
He showed up drunk to his trial with the misguided expectation that his lawyer could get himalesser sentence. Even now Diatchenko struggles to explain what he was thinking."I was trying to bide my time," he says."By going in and pleaing,Iwould be sent away right away." That is, he chose the week of freedom he gained by going to trial--and the infinitesimal odds that he could be acquitted--over the decades he might have been free on parole withasecond-degree sentence. He's not going to make that youthful mistake again.
Because just now, for the first time in his adult life, Diatchenko hasaglint of hope for gaining his freedom. In response to an evolving scientific understanding of children and crime, the state Supreme Judicial Court last year in Diatchenko v. District Attorney overturnedalong-standing law, finding life without parole unconstitutional for juveniles. Now, one by one, these former teenage criminals have the unexpected opportunity to prove they deserveasecond chance.
Diatchenko says he's changed, that he's no longer the impulsive and troubled teenager he was, that he'd never hurt anyone again. But whether he--or any of the state's remaining juvenile lifers--will actually go home is up to the parole board. Which is why Diatchenko's lawyer is nervous. He doesn't want his client to say anything that could hurt his chances of being freed. After much reflection Diatchenko decided to speak with me anyway."The parole board may hold it against me for doing this," he says,"but there wasalot of negative publicity around the juveniles and this isagood way to show how the juvenile can change for the better."
Diatchenko can't sleep lately, excited about the newfound possibility of parole. He has now been locked up almost twice as long as he was free. He has modest dreams: moving into his mother's tidy Roslindale bungalow, openingasmall drain-cleaning business, attending his first Bruins game."It is up to me to show [the parole board] thatIhave changed for the better," he wrote me inaletter,"thatIhave remorse for whatIhave done, and thatIwill live asalaw-abiding citizen if given the opportunity."
Diatchenko's happy childhood began to unravel when he was 10. He remembers the swing set in the backyard of his family's house in Sharon, Christmas at his mother's Latvian Lutheran church, summer afternoons on Lake Massapoag. But his parents' divorce promptedaseries of moves--to Brighton, Norfolk, Brookline, Quincy, Hingham, Jamaica Plain. Sometime during this uprooted period Greg's sister, Iveta, started using drugs. Though she was only12or 13, it got serious fast: Their mother, Benita, was at the police station almost daily. Iveta ­began to run away from home, eventually moving in and out of DYS custody. Greg alternated between constant worry for his sister and resentment over her broken promises to quit using. 
The family spun into chaos. Greg first tried pot at 13. Other drugs quickly followed: cocaine, mescaline, mushrooms. Soon he and his friends were smoking every day, drinking six-packs of Schlitz on the weekends, and dropping tabs of acid into cheap wine. Benita fought with her boyfriend all the time, and in her worry over Iveta, she developedashort fuse with Greg. By 17, he had dropped out of school. He felt adrift, full of anger and frustration."It was very dysfunctional in my house, so for me [drinking] was an escape," Greg recalls."I could numb myself from the arguing."
Greg's circumstances were extreme, but his development asateenager was not: As every parent knows, adolescents are impulsive, self-centered, and thrill-seeking. Neuroscience offers clear reasons why. With increasingly sophisticated technology, scientists can now pinpoint how brain development affects kids' reasoning--or lack thereof. The limbic area, which controls emotion and responds to excitement and reward, is hyperactive during adolescence. Simultaneously, the prefrontal cortex--­responsible for reason, caution, and long-term planning--doesn't mature until the age of 25. 
Recognizing the emerging science that showsachild's brain is not fully developed by the age of 18, courts are increasingly reluctant to give teenagers sentences that can never be revisited. But the notion that teenagers should not be held fully responsible for their actions doesn't sit right with everyone. The victim advocacy group National Organization of Victims of Juvenile Murderers takes issue with what one University of Pennsylvania criminology professor has called"brain overclaim syndrome." As the group writes on its website,"development is not all one thing--it is complex. It is hormonal, sexual, social, cognitive, emotional. Good judgment and good behavior do not come only from the frontal lobe." 
Indeed, other factors--like good parenting andastable home life--are just as crucial. Greg's home life was less violent than that of many juvenile lifers, but it was still unstable and unsupervised, awash in drugs and alcohol. Benita worked five or six nightsaweek asawaitress, so despite her best intentions, she was rarely home to keep tabs on her kids. 
On Saturday afternoon, May 9, 1981, Greg was already trashed when he went to meet his friend John Kennedy, 17. The two hadafew hours to kill beforeaparty in Mission Hill, so they sat at the Brookline VillageTstop and polished off two six-packs andabottle of Southern Comfort before making their way over to Copley Square to meet friends.
There, they were running to catchabus when Greg stopped to spray paint graffiti onanearby wall. Kennedy looked out the back window of the bus as it pulled away, Greg running behind to catch it. Greg was as drunk that night as Kennedy had ever seen him and, Kennedy admits now, in no state to be left alone in the middle of the city. He still remembers the sound of Greg's fist on the back door of the bus as it drove away. 
Alone, Greg wandered for10minutes down Boylston Street, toablock where young hustlers would gather outside of the gay bar Skipper's Lounge. There, Thomas Wharf was cruising foradate in his Cadillac. At 55, Wharf had been divorced for years, and though he kept his sexualityasecret from his family, lately his sons had begun to suspect that he"went both ways."
Wharf had six adult sons, four of whom went on to follow their father into long-haul trucking. Wharf drove fish from Gloucester to the Midwest and then carried beef back east from Omaha. His son Mark remembers riding in the truck's passenger seat, his dad teaching him how to steer the 70-foot rig. Thomas Wharf was 5-foot-8 and beefy, with Popeye forearms,araspy voice, and thick black hair and mustache."He was the greatest guy in the world," Mark says.
What Greg Diatchenko was doing at Skipper's is not clear. Was he hustling? Nothing about his past suggests it, but perhaps he was.Awoman in the upstairs apartment testified that she heard him shout,"Give me all your money, you motherfucker." Was itadrunken mugging gone wrong? His mom says even she doesn't know what happened: When she asked him about it recently, he said,"Mama, can't you understand? I'm too ashamed to talk about it." 
And while Diatchenko heeded the advice of his lawyer not to speak about his crime with me, he will have to talk about it in front of the parole board. Until then, here's what we know from his1981trial: Greg Diatchenko stabbed Thomas Wharf nine times in the driver's seat of Wharf's car. The wounds were so extensive thataparamedic during the trial described Wharf's body as"filleted open." Blood was everywhere--the dashboard, the front seat, the driver's side, the passenger's side--and when the paramedics opened the driver's-side door, more blood poured from Wharf's chest onto the ground. The jury convicted Diatchenko of first-degree murder with malice aforethought and extreme atrocity and cruelty.
Diatchenko's impressionable age, unstable home life, and severe alcoholism, his lawyer hoped, might warrantameasure of mercy, and he tried to introduce them as mitigating factors at sentencing. But none of it mattered. The sentence was mandatory. 
Until last year, any 14-, 15-, or 16-year-old accused of murder in Massachusetts was tried as an adult and sentenced as an adult. ­Seventeen-year-olds were tried and sentenced as adults no matter the charge. Anyone convicted of first-degree murder got life without parole. No exceptions. The law was the most severe of any New England state and among the toughest in the country. Asaresult, by 2009, Massachusetts had four times as many juvenile lifers as all other New England states combined. Asaconvicted murderer, Diatchenko was sentenced to serve his time in Walpole, the state's only maximum-security prison at the time, used to house Massachusetts' most violent inmates. Diatchenko arrived in prison puffy-eyed and crying. He looked even younger than his17years: His hair was blond and thick. His chin and cheeks were smooth. As the prison walls came into view through the windshield of the transport car, Diatchenko thought, This is the end of my life. 
Diatchenko murdered Wharf on the eve of the nation's toughening approach to juvenile crime. Foracentury, children were tried in juvenile courts and sentenced to ­juvenile correctional facilities, which held kids for limited periods and focused on treatment and rehabilitation. Then came the 1980s and early '90s,aviolent era, especially among youth: Between the mid-'80s and mid-'90s, the number of homicides by teenagers with guns climbed steadily each year, peaking in1993at more than 3,000--three times what the yearly rate had previously been. The Central Park jogger case introduced wilding to the national vocabulary. Amid the crack-cocaine epidemic, the war on drugs ushered in mandatory-minimum sentencing. Teenage homicide rates soon declined and have continued to fall, but sentencing laws were transformed forageneration. 
Asayoung man in his twenties, Greg Diatchenko watched the political climate change from behind prison walls. At first, Massachusetts still offered incentives for inmates to rehabilitate themselves; even lifers could move from maximum- to medium- or minimum-security prisons and participate in work-release programs. It wasn't unheard of for the governor to commute first-degree life sentences for exemplary prisoners. Then, in 1987, Massachusetts lifer Willie Horton--who walked away fromaminimum-security prison while onaweekend furlough--committedaviolent assault and rape. After the national, highly politicized backlash over Horton, coupled with the ballooning numbers of inmates serving"tough on crime" sentences, the DOC slashed services available to lifers. They could no longer participate in most vocational or rehabilitation programs. Since they would never get out, the department reasoned, they hada"low need" for programming. 
Massachusetts had long allowed for certain juvenile cases to be"transferred" to adult court, but until the early '90s, these transfers were rare. In 1996, the legislature passed the most recent law: Anyone14and older accused of murder is tried as an adult. No exceptions.
That remained the law until last year. But with Diatchenko, Massachusetts followed the U.S. Supreme Court in an emerging jurisprudence that children are less culpable than adults and easier to rehabilitate. In2005the Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for crimes committed by juveniles. In 2010, it eliminated juvenile life without parole for non-homicide crimes. Then, in 2012, it ruled in Miller v. Alabama that even for homicide crimes, mandatory life without parole sentences were unconstitutional.Akid under 18--evenamurderer--is too young to write off entirely, the court said."Incorrigibility," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote,"is inconsistent with youth."
The court's reasoning can be hard to square with the reality ofabrutal crime. Last year, Massachusetts residents were shocked when Colleen Ritzer,abeloved 24-year-old math teacher, was found dead in the woods behind Danvers High School. Shortly after police arrested her then-14-year-old student Philip Chism for the murder, the Supreme Judicial Court outlawed life without parole for juveniles. If convicted, Chism will facealife sentence. But because of the state court's ruling in Diatchenko, he'd be eligible for parole after15years. Feeling betrayed, Ritzer's family issuedastatement:"There will never be 'parole' for our family's life sentence without Colleen." 
Recently, several victims' families have worked together to ensure their loved ones' killers never get out. In February, the family of Beth Brodie, who was15when she was beaten to death byaclassmate in 1992, heldacandlelight vigil to protest parole for her killer. Three months later, Brodie's family and others deliveredapetition with 15,000 signatures to Governor Patrick, urging him to limit the new ruling's application."To prepare foraparole hearing every three to five years retraumatizes victims' families over and over again," Brodie's brother Sean Aylward told me. 
Until the legislature passesanew law that's compliant with Miller, juveniles convicted of first-degree murder will serve second-degree sentences:15years to life. But whether they get out after15years, die in prison, or serve some stretch of years in between hinges on their ability to improve themselves and prove it to the parole board. From2011until May of this year, according to Patricia Garin, who tracks parole numbers asacodirector of the Northeastern Prisoners' Rights Clinic, the board has held hearings for365lifers. Twenty-eight went home. Among juvenile second-degree lifers, the number was four.
Mark Wharf, son of Diatchenko's victim, is grappling with ambivalence over the parole hearing Diatchenko will eventually have. As one of only two of Thomas's surviving sons, he feels it's up to him to represent his family. He says he will not attend the hearing. He considered writingaletter but then decided to leave it be."He's been in34years," Mark says."That's actuallyalifetime right there. Maybe he paid his dues. If they give him parole, they give him parole. If they don't, they don't." 
The teenage Diatchenko arrived at Walpole scrawny and scared. He cried constantly. Throughafamily friend, he says, he foundagroup of guys to keep an eye on him, and he soon learned to projectatough-guy image to fit in. The guards, though, told him that they saw through his posturing. That tough-guy image doesn't fly here, he recalls them saying. You'reagood kid. If you keep your nose clean and stay out of trouble, you can go to Norfolk or someplace better than this. 
He was21when he decided to heed their advice. He stopped talking back. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and joined the Reach Out program, giving tours to teenagers at risk of ending up in prison. He got his GED, and found it felt good to be back inaclassroom; he was proud when his teacher told him his score was the highest in his class. Five months later he was rewarded withatransfer to Norfolk.
There, he joined the Lifers' Group, and took on several charity projects, including Toys for Tots, building wooden toys for children at area hospitals. He gotajob in the plumbing shop and provedafast learner, unclogging drains, adjusting flushometers, and repairing pipes."It's honest work," he says. After20years on the job, he is now the prison's chief plumber, often called in the middle of the night in an emergency. It feels good, he says, to be"one of the main guys that people look to keep the institution running."
If Diatchenko were servingasecond-degree sentence, cynical observers might look at all he has accomplished in prison and think, You're just trying to impress the parole board. But until last year, Diatchenko had no hope of ever getting out. He just did it."I just knew that even ifInever got out,Ican still live," he says."I said, 'Man, this is it. This is where I'm going to be. Make the best of it.'" 
Diatchenko enrolled in Boston University's Prison Education Program, where he is"an outstanding student," as one professor described him in an affidavit:"conscientious, diligent, courteous, focused, and above all, critically engaged and intellectually aware." He has read Michael Pollan, Aristotle, taken music and sociology and Irish Studies. In June, he graduated cum laude withabachelor's degree anda3.63 GPA.
Almost10years ago,afriend brought him to his first meeting of the prison's Buddhist group. It was unfamiliar at first: chanting in Korean and meditation. But the teachings resonated, and he kept going back. 
In 2007, Diatchenko committed to live according to Buddhist principles inarite called taking the Five Precepts. He meditates every day at sunup and sundown. Buddhism has taught him that"life is being mindful," he says."Everything we do has an effect on other people. When people have contact with me,Iwant them to come away with something positive." At his ceremony, he vowed not to take life, not to steal, not to act badly in lust, not to lie, not to drink alcohol. May all my offenses, he chanted, now be totally consumed in an instant, as fire burns dry grass, extinguishing all things until nothing remains.
Greg Diatchenko turned50in February. His trim brown hair is gelled and combed back and his smile reveals decades of prison dental care. His eyes cloud pink whenIask him whether he would give himselfasecond chance if he wereamember of Thomas Wharf's family.
"Believe me, I've thought about thatalot over the years," he says."It never escapes my mind. WhenIthink about what happ--" He rephrases:"what I've done, in my life. And the impact that had on their family...." He's quiet and searches for words."There's nothingIcan do to erase whatIdid. Nothing. AndIcan say I'm sorryamillion times. AndIwould understand if they didn't want to hear it. But I've made great strides to better myself asahuman being." Diatchenko blinks back tears."I would hate me," he practically whispers. 
 The parole board often focuses on the severity of the crime, as much if not more than they consider the work an inmate has done to better himself in the decades since. Diatchenko knows his odds. But regardless of the outcome of his hearing,"even ifInever get out, I'm going to continue to do whatIdo in here," he says."Nothing's ever going to change that. I'm still going to be part of the Buddhist community. I'm still going to work. I'm still going to get up every day--" his voice shakes, and he takesadeep breath as he continues,"and I'm going to try to help others in here as long asIcan.Ishould have been doing that all my life."
Diatchenko will likely appear before the parole board next year.

The Patrick Problem
Nobody on the Democratic ticket wants to criticize Deval--which is playing right into Charlie Baker's hands. Plus, why Marty Walsh and his Beacon Hill brethren are dead wrong about the probation scandal.
By David S. Bernstein
On the 13th day of June, whistles and cheers filled Worcester's cavernous DCU Center, where Massachusetts' Democrats had gathered en masse to celebrate the life and work of the man who had emerged as the delegates' clear choice for governor. As they applauded, the man of the moment stepped across the stage to address the crowd. There was just one small problem: Deval Patrick is not running forathird term.
"We are leading today not because we catered to the powerful, not because we kept the finger in the political wind, and not because we avoided the tough issues," Patrick bellowed,"but because we stood up for what we believed, and governed for the next generation."
June13wasaFriday, and what happened that night may have been an omen of what is to come this fall. Afterabit ofarough start, Patrick has becomeapopular governor in what is arguably the most important progressive state in America. As he prepares to leave office, he hasafavorability rating of56percent. But what comes next will beafar cry from Deval Patrick. With no clear successor---former Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray is not running--a cluttered field of five Democrats had assembled to succeed him, though none of them spoke that evening or shared the stage with Patrick, preventing anyone from basking in his reflected glory. In fact, the governor continues to assiduously avoid the appearance of pickingafavorite. By the time the five candidates spoke at the convention the following day, Patrick's rhetorical flash had dissipated, and none of the candidates--three of whom qualified for the ballot for the September9primary election--was able to muster anything nearly as moving as the governor's oration.
That's not surprising. There are few politicians anywhere who deliveraspeech as well as Patrick--not even President Barack Obama, who had givenagraduation address in the same building, just two days earlier, to students from Worcester Technical High. But here'saterrifying sign if you're hoping to seeaDemocrat succeed Patrick on Beacon Hill: Most of the delegatesIspoke with in Worcester were more enthused about what the candidates for attorney general had to say than anything coming from any candidate for governor.
What happened? Patrick will beatough act to follow, and not just with the devoted party activists in Worcester. He has become an oversize presence in the commonwealth, whether reassuring us in his MEMA jacket duringacrisis or choking up with emotion as he makes the case for accepting refugee children into the state. Asaresult of his popularity, his light shines so bright that the candidates are indistinguishable in the glow. All of the remaining Democrats--Attorney General Martha Coakley, Treasurer Steve Grossman, and healthcare executive Don Berwick--fell in step with his positions, if anybody attending the convention cared to notice.
If the Democratic primary has beenatepid affair, lacking in debate over the direction of the state--as it has seemed to me--that hasalot to do with the specter of the current governor looming over the candidates. Call it the Patrick Problem. They can't, or at least won't, criticize Patrick, and asaresult have melded into identical yes men. Coakley, Grossman, and Berwick faceaproblem similar to the one that confronted George H. W. Bush in following Ronald Reagan, and that Al Gore faced in attempting to succeed Bill Clinton, says Democratic strategist and Liberty Square Group president Scott Ferson. They're all essentially running for Patrick's third term."Why you?" Ferson says."Because he can't run again."
To get some perspective on what's different about this race,Iwent to see someone who's been through the campaign cycle herself. Shannon O'Brien, the former state treasurer, was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002. (She lost to Mitt Romney inabid to succeed Jane Swift.) This is the first time since 1990, she noted, that the state's Democrats have had to chooseasuccessor to an incumbent governor from their own party.
Traditionally, incumbency is an asset, but it may not be helping this time. For one thing, during Patrick's eight years as head of the state party, he's focused on activating grassroots liberals--a strategy that has resulted inaparty infrastructure that rigidly enforces his ideological views, and expects the same from its candidates.
At the Worcester convention, it was clear how little room is left for moderates. Joe Avellone, for instance, who opposed both single-payer healthcare and an indexed gas tax, could not muster nearly enough support to earnaspot on the September ballot, even with help from powerful supporters like Boston Congressman Steve Lynch and Worcester Mayor Joe Petty. The result:alistless trio of candidates with nearly identical platforms, unable to distinguish themselves on policy.
Also, O'Brien points out, it'salot easier to talk about new directions when you can criticize the current governor. However, these three can't afford to. For one thing, whoever wins will desperately need Patrick's endorsement in the general election. And for another, it is nearly impossible to make political hay with primary voters out of criticizingagovernor with Patrick's popularity."That's whyIthink you're not seeing as much intensity," O'Brien says.
When Grossman dared suggest in June that Patrick deserved onlyaB-plus grade, he was taken to task by Coakley, among others. In July, it was Coakley's turn to walk the plank and offeramodest critique of the governor's tenure: She promised not to have any reprise of the Annie Dookhan crime-lab scandal under her watch. The result? Not only did Grossman slap her down, but Patrick himself also jumped in, calling her comments"foolish.""You have Democrats who are loyal toapopular incumbent," O'Brien says."So even pointing out differences can be uncomfortable."
In fact, the Democratic candidates spend much of their time promising not to do much of anything but follow Patrick's current direction. Since fiery criticism of the incumbent has been replaced by full-throated agreement on every issue, it's been as colorless and calculatedaprimary race as I've witnessed in the20years since Mark Roosevelt won the right to be trounced by Bill Weld.
Onasunny wednesday in july,istood outside at Assembly Row to watch Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone endorse Grossman. Standing inasmall plaza in front of an ice cream parlor, the candidate proudly declared that"this campaign is about one thing: who will build on Deval Patrick's foundation." With no one to criticize and no controversy, it's not surprising that Grossman didn't exactly snatch the attention of the families lined up next toagiant giraffe near the Legoland entrance across the street. Nor did Grossman--the state treasurer, holder of the Democratic Party's official endorsement, and recipient of the most contributions and endorsements in the race---attract much media to one of the biggest endorsements of the summer. Only Sharman Sacchetti of WFXT,aWicked Local reporter, andIbothered to show up. As usual, Grossman spoke too long about himself. Then he asked if there were any questions. There weren't.
Likewise, whenIcaught up with Grossmanafew weeks later, he was chatting with potential voters through an interpreter at the Milford Portuguese Picnic. After each brief conversation, he infuriated the translator by darting back to me to explain how the story he'd just heard spoke directly to one of his themes or policies.
"They are the story of Massachusetts," he said of one hard-working Methuen family, whose two children will be able to attend their city's new high school, financed largely through the Massachusetts School Building Authority in Grossman's office.
But in truth, there was little exciting or new about what Grossman had to say, despite his efforts to distinguish himself as an experienced job creator. Instead, he was once again simply casting himself as the candidate to carry on Patrick's work, saying,"Deval's createdastrong foundation." Missing an opportunity to separate himself from Patrick and his fellow candidates, Grossman was careful not to shineanegative light on unemployment numbers or any unfinished business.
The previous day,iwas with coakley at the launch of her Latinos por Coakley initiative at O'Neill Park, in Lawrence, whenIasked her what she thought this campaign is about. Choosing her words carefully, Coakley said,"It's about maximizing the opportunities here in Massachusetts, with our knowledge economy and our great school systems, to do even better, and to build an economy on our terms, in every region of the state." These are the types of public events Coakley has typically done over the summer: quick appearances to boost the morale ofasmall group of enthusiastic supporters, usually right before they hit the streets and knock on doors asking for support. It seemed clear to me that Coakley was walkingafine line between praising the economic gains under Patrick and suggesting that more must still be done. Still, grinding outamessage that things are good but could be better is hardlyacompelling way to galvanize voters. In fact, inaprimary where Coakley has led byawide margin throughout, it feels more like she's laying the groundwork for the general election thanareal play to win the primary.
AsIasked political observers about the seemingly substance-free nature of the election so far, many put the blame on cautious, uninspiring candidates, particularly Coakley, who they say is playing safe with her lead."I think it's by design," says Democratic consultant Dan Payne, who did some work for independent candidate Jeff McCormick earlier in the campaign. When it comes to the primary, Payne says,"Coakley has no reason to make it about anything."
On July 15,Iasked Berwick the same question about the meaning of the election. Despite positioning himself as the most liberal candidate in the race, he too answered in terms of moving forward on Patrick's progress--and did so in very Patrick-esque language."I'm trying to make this election aboutasense of values," he said."If we haveacampaign that's just about maintaining things the way that they are, or walking away, that's not good enough for me."
On paper, Berwick is the most Patrick-like candidate.Afirst-time hopeful like Patrick was in 2006, Berwick also has an impressive White House post on his rsum: administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Similarly, Patrick had been assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.
But so far, it doesn't seem as though Democrats are looking for another Patrick, circa 2006. Back then, they were looking forachange after four years of Mitt Romney. Today, they want the2014Patrick, who is the face of Beacon Hill. They want the status quo.
For his part, Patrick has meticulously avoided taking sides in the Democratic primary. Thanks to former Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray's forced withdrawal from the political arena, Patrick has no natural successor, and he has managed to stay out of the fray. But that will likely change, dramatically, once the primary concludes andaDemocratic nominee is chosen on September 9.
Whatever Patrick's future plans, he knows that his legacy depends in large part onaDemocrat winning in November. After all, as Ferson says, the election will be seen asareferendum on Patrick. Just as Patrick's victory over Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey in2006was seen more as voters stickingaboot up Romney's backside on his way out of office than asaringing endorsement of all Patrick had promised during his campaign, this election will be Patrick's ultimate report card. Patrick's legacy will also depend on whether the programs he started in education, criminal justice, and healthcare carry on, or are reversed underaRepublican before they bear fruit.
The emphasis on Patrick's legacy is the silencer on this election cycle: It keeps his potential successors from criticizing him, while he tacitly complies by staying neutral. Yet there'sabitter irony. Patrick's reluctance to throw his weight behindacandidate in the primary, according to Democrats I've spoken with, has not only contributed to the lackluster campaign but is also inadvertently playing into the hands of expected Republican nominee Charlie Baker.
Speaking at the state GOP convention in March, Baker was clear that he wants this election to be about nothing, or at least not about policy issues. In fact, he's gone out of his way to erase the policy differences between the Democrats and himself onarange of subjects, from climate change to accepting undocumented children. Instead, Baker has said, he wants this election to be about competent management. Rattling offachecklist of Patrick-administration sins--the Department of Children and Families fiasco, the healthcare-exchange website disaster, and others--Baker is already casting the race asachoice of who will be the better CEO to run the state. Baker's running mate, lieutenant governor hopeful Karyn Polito, echoed that sentiment whenIran into her at the Milford Portuguese Picnic."The position of governor is really the big manager of the state," she said, adding that voters want accountability"after one party [has controlled] every aspect of the government." So while Democrats must figure outaway to work around Patrick's looming presence, Republicans delight as they get the chance to tell voters about the problems he's left for somebody to clean up, with virtually no counter. The Democratic convention in June, by contrast, included only occasional mentions of the expected Republican nominee. There has been very little attempt to clearly spell out the choices voters will face in November--again, as O'Brien notes, partlyafunction of Democrats being the party in power."When you run againstanonincumbent, it's like running against air," she says.Alot of hot, stagnant air. While the Democratic primary candidates are all running in circles vying for the"most like Patrick" award, the important policy debates and differences are floating out to sea unnoticed and unexamined. Voters may be resolute in the desire forathird-term Patrick to lead the state in 2015, but the effect of the Patrick Problem,Ifear, is thatafield of indistinguishable candidates will not draw voters to the polls. After September 9, however, that should all change.
Whoever wins the Democratic primary will need to land punches, raise the kind of big money absent from the candidates' current fundraising efforts, and galvanize minorities and young voters to show up for the November vote. For all three tasks, nobody will be more effective than Patrick.
So expect to see and hearalot from the outgoing governor this fall, as he makes the case to reward him withathird term--when the Patrick Problem becomes the Patrick Advantage.
Patronage, Power, and the Probation Department Scandal
Remember back in2007when Deval Patrick got caught makingacall to Citigroup on behalf of Ameriquest? The details were boring, but enlightening. Ameriquest was in dire need of cash, and the governor had recently resigned from the board of its parent company, ACC Capital Holdings. Patrick's buddy,aboard director at ACC, asked him to call Citigroup's Bob Rubin to put inagood word for Ameriquest. Patrick knew full well that Citigroup did lots of business with the state--thereby creatingapotential conflict of interest--but he made the call anyway, later claiming he was dialing not as the governor but merely asapersonal gesture. Y'know--just Deval being Deval.
It occurred to me back then that people who ascend to powerful positions should receive training on the nature of power as currency, how it is perceived by others, and when it is and isn't appropriate to trade in it. Because, frankly, it isn't always obvious.
Those lessons would still be handy around Beacon Hill, where even after four years, an awful lot of people seem to have no idea what anybody did wrong in the probation department patronage scandal--which in July resulted in convictions of former Commissioner John O'Brien and two others.
"It makes me angry that the people are trying to make the things we do for our constituents suddenlyabad thing," House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad told the Globe. Which is essentially the same thingahigh-ranking Patrick administration official ranted to me ataholiday party soon after the independent Ware Report exposed the rigged patronage system in 2010: that suddenly the perfectly innocent and appropriate act of writingaletter of recommendation foraconstituent was being treated as an unethical act.
Even more stunning was Mayor Marty Walsh's statement--first delivered to Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on WGBH's Boston Public Radio--that he thought O'Brien was not guilty. Bear in mind that Walsh is now the top man in City Hall's pyramid, employing thousands of government workers. He was not onlyamember of the legislature during the entire period at issue in the O'Brien trial, but as of last year, he was also chairman of the House Committee on Ethics.
I have sympathy for these folks, becauseIbelieve that for the most part they really did mean well and--because they didn't get the training I'm talking about--they really have no idea that what they're saying is utter bullshit.
A letter of recommendation from the House speaker or Senate president or Ways and Means Committee chair is not justaletter of recommendation to the person receiving it, any more thanarequest from the boss to attend an event after work is justarequest, orareference from the new governor to the head ofacompany that does business with his state is justareference. Especially if those letters or requests are followed up with calls checking to see whether action was taken.
That doesn't make the letter illegal. But it's notasimple, innocent letter.
Let me useacultural reference: If your husband is Tony Soprano, your request foraletter of reference to Georgetown for your daughter Meadow is not justafriendly request. The recommender didn't write the letter because she appreciated the ricotta pie Carmela made for her, or because of Meadow's merit--she wrote it because, even though nobody said anything about breaking kneecaps, that threat is implicit when Mrs. Soprano asks forafavor.
As for the recipients of these requests, some might treat them just like any other--they'll hire the best candidates, and the best candidates only--and afterward, they may or may not find themselves punished. Others, however, will findaway to be accommodating, in order to avoid finding out if there will be consequences.
Still others will embrace the opportunity to curry favor with the powerful. They will want to be known as accommodating, as their own way of trading in the currency of power. That's what John O'Brien did at probation. And this willingness can quickly become apparent to those making the requests, who then begin directing more that way.
Again, that's not inherentlyacrime. Managers often have discretion to hire as they please, so if they want, they can stock up with inferior staff to curry favor with powerful people. That'sawaste of government resources, it's unfair to other applicants, and in some cases it can get extreme--witness Auditor Joe DeNucci's office. It's clearly bad, even if it's not illegal.
And it's disingenuous for the powerful people sending those requests to act as if they're just making innocent recommendations. When you look at the sponsor lists, with certain lawmakers (especially those with the most direct power over the probation department) recommendingadozen or more people, and when you consider the testimony and evidence that senators knew to bring requests for probation jobs through the Senate president, it's obvious that they knew they hadaparticularly accommodating friend in O'Brien.
Let's speak frankly: Everybody knew probation wasapatronage dumping ground--that was why Governor Patrick wanted control over the department, and also why the legislature refused to hand it over. The governor said it to me on camera, in an interview not long before the scandal broke. (Which is to take nothing away from the superb reporting of the Globe in uncovering all the stunning details in the Spotlight investigation credited with prompting the feds' probe.)
So these were not just innocent recommendations. What took it all from bad to illegal was that the probation department hadasystem in place to ensureafair process for applicants, and the people running it deliberately chucked that process out the window in order to accommodate hiring requests from power players with whom they were trying to curry favor, in cases when the system would clearly not lead to that person getting hired.
You can't do that.Astate agency can't set upaprocess for awarding something of value, tell everybody what the process is, let everyone apply and go through that process, and then secretly award the thing of value to somebody who failed that process--all because someone in power said so. That's not patronage, that's fraud. And fraud, as the jury found, is exactly what O'Brien committed.
Of course, the feds haveabunch of ways to turn one crime intoaseries of crimes, because that's what they and the statutes are set up to do.
Now, that's the ledger as read on O'Brien's side. Everybody is understandably asking why the other side of the equation--the powerful legislators who made all those requests--aren't being prosecuted as well. How can there have beenaquid withoutaquo?
That'safair question, to which we don't know the answer. But it's not inherently true that the legislators knew that their very accommodating friends at probation were committing fraud. In fact,Isuspect that they didn't know, or that they didn't really think about it.
Power isacurrency on Beacon Hill, and that reality isn't going to change anytime soon. There will be Ways and Means chairs who use the funding of public projects to build loyalty--and punish disloyalty--on the way to becoming speaker or Senate president. There will be horse-trading for votes, and for wording in bills, and for office space and staff and everything else. And an awful lot of this happens implicitly, not in explicit quid pro quo exchanges.
So it can be confusing for those same power wielders to see that there's anything wrong with recommending that the very accommodating people at probation hireacertain person, whose gainful employment would earn some goodwill in the district or make someone's girlfriend happy. Especially since that kind of thing has always happened, particularly inastate like Massachusetts, where modern politics grew out of urban political machine operations.
Which gets me back to whereIbegan: the need for people who attain positions of power to have this awareness taught to them.
It's fine to haveasystem in which power is currency among legislators, as they perform their prescribed duties. It's not fine if power is used like Carmela's ricotta pie to get anybody to do what you want withoutalot of questions.
And I'll close with another favorite Sopranos moment (with apologies--I swear I'm not trying to tie any Italian-American stereotypes to Bob DeLeo; it's justagreat show). Remember when Tony Soprano's therapist has essentially just suggested that normal people don't resort to physical brutality? Tony, clearly perplexed, asks in response:"Then how do you get people to do what you want?"
The answer, of course, is that you're not always supposed to get what you want. Not even if you're the speaker, or the Senate president. That can be difficult for some people to see, whether their usual technique for getting what they want is leg-breaking or budget-writing.
Let this bealesson to them. No more.

What Happened to the Phoenix?
(And Can it Rise Again?)
By Peter Vigneron
Thirty years ago, the Phoenix was the essential paper for a new generation of readers: those interested in a smart, countercultural alternative to the offerings of the mainstream press. Its writers and editors, many of whom are now among the most distinguished in American journalism, surveyed the landscape here in the city and created an enduring body of work in culture, the arts, politics, even sports. Its music section was read nationally, exerting-along with the Village Voice and Rolling Stone-a powerful influence on early rock criticism. The Phoenix helped develop an entire genre of writing, media criticism, that is now a staple in most papers and magazines. The paper was lucrative for its owner, Stephen Mindich. It was important.
Today the Phoenix is fighting to survive in a radically different environment. All media have suffered in the age of the Internet, of course, but alt weeklies have taken the worst of it: They've lost not only their most profitable revenue source, classified ads, but also their monopoly on the alternative ethic, and they have been unusually slow in establishing compelling and profitable websites. Many have folded, and nearly all of the survivors have seen both readership and advertising decline dramatically. In the past two years, for instance, the Chicago Reader has been redesigned and sold, and both the Village Voice and SF Weekly have let go key staff writers. The Phoenix itself has fared better than most, but it, too, has suffered financially and has had to make difficult cuts in staff and coverage. Since 2008, Mindich says, we have navigated through rough seas. In May, Mindich, who has owned the paper for more than four decades, sold its sister radio station, WFNX, and laid off all but four of the station's 13 staffers. For several weeks this past summer, it seemed likely that the same fate would befall the paper-Mindich is 69, after all, and he seems to have been making plans to retire for years. But in August he surprised everybody by announcing that he would make a new run at profitability, by transforming the Phoenix into a glossy weekly magazine. Ever since, he's been putting in long hours at the office. 
The new Phoenix, the first issue of which appeared on September 20, is a bold, colorful hybrid. Mindich took the Phoenix and Stuff, a lifestyle magazine he also owns, and combined them into a single glossy publication. For the most part, what you'll find in the new magazine are traditional but abbreviated Phoenix stories, like Lloyd Schwartz's classical-music reviews and David Bernstein's sharp political analysis, only now they're stacked next to photo-heavy fashion spreads. At times, though, there are some odd departures-the feature story in the Halloween issue, for example, was an apparently credulous profile of a ghost hunter. 
Not surprisingly, the sale of WFNX and the transformation of the Phoenix have been portrayed in some circles as the end of a grand era in Boston media and even in American journalism. Salon weighed in on October 6 with an article titled Goodbye, Alt-Weeklies, in which Will Doig claimed that the old paper had disappeared in a puff of newsprint. The next day, the editor in chief of the Phoenix, Carly Carioli, responded by calling the Salon article shamelessly shoddy, and rejected its charge that the publication is substantively different. We have said for decades that we are a magazine in newsprint form, he wrote. Now we're a magazine in magazine form. 
By all accounts, Mindich remains devoted to the idea of alternative media. The Phoenix is his life's work, and the shift to glossy has the feel of a real effort for survival, not a last-ditch move to sell. But can you save a publication that for many years has been neither lucrative nor especially relevant?
Mindich is short, balding, and wears a mustache and a long ponytail. He's smart and talks with a smoker's rasp. He can be polarizing, but he is also respected. I hated his guts, says Joe Keohane, the former editor of the Weekly Dig, who has also worked for Boston magazine, but I still came away kind of admiring his scrappiness. 
Mindich identifies as a progressive, but he occasionally strays into libertarian territory. In the early 1980s he busted an attempt to form a union and physically fought a janitor who'd been organizing, and in 2002 he made national headlines when his paper's website linked to a video of the beheading of the journalist Daniel Pearl. Rick Gallagher, the Phoenix's CFO and COO until 2010, says Mindich is a patriot, a defender of the right to free speech. When I asked Mindich what appealed to him about journalism, he responded with a quote from Oscar Wilde: Somebody-was it Burke?-called journalism the fourth estate. That was true at the time, no doubt. But at the present moment it is the only estate. 
After earning bachelor's and master's degrees at Boston University, Mindich started at the Phoenix as a writer in 1967, when the paper was only a year old and called Boston After Dark. He soon became its publisher and part owner, and in 1972, he bought the competition, the Cambridge Phoenix, and renamed his paper the Boston Phoenix. Right from the start, he told me, he had two goals for the Phoenix. He wanted it to be a destination for young readers interested in the arts and culture, and he wanted to provide a higher standard of commentary than was then available in Boston. 
He succeeded on both counts. The Globe and the Herald didn't understand music or the arts, and by hiring writers who did, the Phoenix quickly captured an important new audience. Its writers had space for long reviews and were not bound by the staid traditions of daily papers. They could swear. If an album sucked, they could say so. The news organizations were trapped in a way of presenting news, says Marty Linsky, who from 1975 to 1979 edited the Real Paper, a rival alt weekly that Mindich bought in 1981. They weren't helping readers understand what was going on, and it created a huge opportunity. 
The Phoenix also developed a reputation as a writer's paper. It was unique in its function for writers, says Mark Jurkowitz, who was the Phoenix's media critic from 1987 through 1994, and again from 2005 to 2006. It was clearly a place you wanted to go if you were thinking about long-form journalism. This was especially true for young critics, who had seen a succession of top talent make extended stops at the paper before moving to major national publications. Janet Maslin, the paper's music and film critic in the early 1970s, left for the New York Times and was succeeded by David Denby. 
Denby, for his part, ended up at the New Yorker, and was succeeded by Stephen Schiff. And Schiff went to Vanity Fair, but only after training David Edelstein, now the film critic for New York. It was thrilling to be part of that, Lloyd Schwartz says. 
The Phoenix of the 1970s and 1980s is often remembered as a political paper, and it was indeed strong on state politics, with Sidney Blumenthal, Jon Keller, and Charlie Pierce all contributing. But it had a national reputation, too, built on cultural criticism. Alternative papers insisted that culture was as important as politics, Kit Rachlis, the paper's former music editor, says. In those days, in newspapers, to be a culture writer was to be on the bottom of the hierarchy. The Phoenix helped change that. But the moment didn't last. 
Until the advent of the Internet, the Phoenix, like so many other papers, made its money on classifieds. It was a source of culture and news, but it was also the place where young people looked when they needed a place to live, or a date, or someone to play in their band. In 1989, Mindich expanded the idea and formed a company called Tele-Publishing Inc., which allowed people to respond to personal ads through voice mail. He licensed the TPI system to alt weeklies across the country and abroad, and eventually the enterprise employed more than 200 people. For a period in the late 1990s, TPI provided one of the largest shares of the company's revenue, along with the classifieds. 
The Internet broke both businesses, almost at the same time. What has really killed the alt weeklies is that they were so dependent on classified ads, says Dan Kennedy, an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern who was a media critic at the Phoenix for 11 years. The dating site Match.com alone decimated TPI, which laid off scores of workers before shutting down this past spring. 
And advertising wasn't the only part of the alt-weekly proposition that suffered in the new digital age. Around 2003, 2004, you could feel all that alternative energy dissipate onto the Web, Kit Rachlis says. What was really alternative? It was blogging: the earliest generation of bloggers. And then the economic model for newspapers was just blowing up. 
So was the economic model for radio, which meant trouble for Mindich's WFNX. The station had never made much money, but it played a key role in discovering new music and helped Mindich make good on his commitment to free expression. In 1997, for example, the station broadcast a live reading of Allen Ginsberg's Howl, in violation of federal obscenity laws. 
Mindich founded WFNX in 1982, but it wasn't until the explosion of grunge in the early 1990s that the station gained widespread acclaim. Famously, in 1994, a WFNX-sponsored concert at the Hatch Shell featuring Green Day turned into a riot, and in the months that followed, the station achieved some of its highest ratings ever. (According to Brad Mindich, Stephen Mindich's son, his father had trouble deciding whether to make WFNX a rock or a country station when it launched. Brad, a teenager at the time, insisted that it needed to be rock.) 
Just as the Phoenix exploited the opportunity presented by an underserved market for cultural criticism, WFNX did so with the underserved market for music. It was the first station in the city to play bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and it continued to explore alternative music well into the 2000s, with a four-hour show on Sunday nights devoted to local bands. WFNX-sponsored concerts at City Hall Plaza drew audiences in the tens of thousands, and local acts Guster, the Dresden Dolls, and Passion Pit all got early radio play on the station. Symbolically, they meant a lot, says Oedipus, the longtime program director at the rock radio station WBCN. 
But not many people were able to listen: WFNX was limited by a weak signal. Per FCC rules, its 101.7 frequency could not broadcast in Greater Boston at more than 3,000 watts, because anything higher would interfere with nearby frequencies. This restriction limited 'FNX's listenership to the immediate downtown area and several communities along the North Shore. The signal faded to static 20 miles west of Boston and was all but inaudible south of Dedham. By contrast, WBCN, which shut down in 2009, broadcast at 50,000 watts. 
Radio has always been a precarious business, and in May, Mindich, already struggling to keep the Phoenix alive, sold his license for 101.7 to Clear Channel, the massive media company based in Texas, for $14.5 million. (The station is now called The Harbor and plays a mix of classic rock and adult contemporary that's worth actively avoiding.) 
But breaking and promoting new music on the radio, which had been a core function of alt-rock stations for decades, has become vastly less important in the past five years. Radio stations were once tastemakers, but they're now more likely to follow trends established online. Shred, a former radio DJ and now a booker for the Middle East in Central Square, says he believes that musicians in Boston have been mostly unaffected by WFNX's demise. They'd be online, promoting their music on their own, even if the station were still around. 
In 2007 Mindich put in motion a succession plan. The Phoenix's longtime president, Barry Morris, stepped down at the end of 2006, and Brad Mindich, who was then 38, took over day-to-day operations. Morris, according to several people I spoke with for this story, is a driven, detail-oriented boss. Brad told me that Morris had been a tough manager with an unbelievable will to get things done. Brad, though, took a different approach. Several people told me that he decided to lead with a softer touch. Brad's M.O. was, 'I'm not Barry, I trust people,' says a former sales executive who was laid off this past summer. 
Brad told me in October that his business strategy was meant to transform the Phoenix from a collection of independent entities into a unified media company. He used the word convergence, which in plain English means luring advertisers with offers to promote their products simultaneously across the company's various formats. From a sales standpoint, says Rick Gallagher, the former Phoenix CFO and COO, modern media buyers are not going to be too happy if the newspaper person comes in to sell them something, and then the radio person comes in, and the Web person comes in, and the mobile person comes in. 
The company-wide collaborations weren't limited to sales, and for a time the strategy seemed to be working. There was a game plan that made sense, a decent idea of creating a synergistic media empire, says Lance Gould, who edited the Phoenix from 2007 through 2010. Carly Carioli, who was then editing the website, took on a major redesign, and Phoenix music writers intensified their collaboration with DJs at WFNX. Brad Mindich, who was formerly a professional musician, gave the station wide discretion in programming and staffing. The former WFNX host Jim Murray says that his three years at the station, which ended in 2010, represent easily the most fun, creative, familylike atmosphere I've ever had the opportunity to work in. 
But the strategy ultimately failed. Brad Mindich and Gallagher both say the sales staff resisted centralizing, and that there were minor skirmishes over who would get access to the biggest advertisers. According to two former salespeople, employees were accustomed to Morris resolving these kinds of disputes, but Brad preferred not to intervene. By 2009, former staffers say, Brad had developed a reputation as an uninterested and even ineffective boss. 
At the same time, the economy tanked, and, according to a former sales executive with access to the paper's financial records, in the years that followed, revenues generated by Stuff and the Phoenix (which still maintains newsprint editions in Portland and Providence) declined dramatically. Brad and his team felt that the paper was overstaffed and underperforming financially, which reportedly led to clashes with Gould, the editor, who opposed cutting political and arts coverage, and with both Stephen Mindich and the executive editor, Peter Kadzis, who also opposed cuts to the editorial staff. Brad, for his part, acknowledges that there were tough discussions but denies that anything escalated to the level of clashes. Everyone worked together, he says, and we got done what we needed to get done. 
By 2009, according to Rick Gallagher, the company was out of cash. Employees at WFNX and the Phoenix began noticing that bills were going unpaid. Three former WFNX hosts told me that an electric-company rep once appeared at the station's headquarters in Lynn's old Arts Building to collect payment, and that a staff member had to write a personal check to keep the lights on. FedEx refused to pick up packages at the Phoenix offices, and several people from both WFNX and the paper told me that their 401(k) accounts were not funded on schedule. Stephen Mindich acknowledges that the Phoenix did indeed have cash-flow problems that resulted in some of our vendors not being paid on a timely basis, and that during a single pay period in 2010 his finance department failed to make certain contributions, a problem he fixed in compliance with all state and federal regulations as soon as it was discovered. We were no more immune to the exigencies of the Great Recession than anybody else, he says. 
In April 2010, Stephen hired an outside consultant, and the next month, the company laid off three executives who had been hired by Brad: Gallagher; the corporate controller, Michael Notkin; and the assistant corporate controller, Chris Crandall. The moves were seen as a repudiation of Brad's business plan, and by late 2011 Brad had ceased regularly coming into the office. This past spring, Brad announced he was leaving the company to start an entertainment consulting firm. For the first time in my entire working life, he says, he and Stephen are interacting simply as father and son, which is great for both of us. 
Since the mid-1980s, the Phoenix has operated out of a 32,000-square-foot brick building at 126 Brookline Avenue, right around the corner from Fenway Park, but this past summer Mindich sold part of the space and moved editorial operations upstairs to a smaller office on the third floor. 
The company isn't standing still, however. On October 31, Carioli and the music editor, Michael Marotta, relaunched WFNX as an Internet radio station. It plays the same mix of music as the old station, although most of the former WFNX staff is now working for the Globe at a Web radio station called RadioBDC. Carioli told me that he eventually hopes to reintroduce sportswriting to the Phoenix, and he is exploring ways to include more technology coverage. But so far the magazine is relatively unchanged from its old newsprint self. It seems to me it's the same Phoenix, but it's the same Phoenix in a slicker skin, Jack Shafer, Reuters' media critic and a former alt-weekly editor, told me. I think that they've made a very smart decision. According to Kadzis, the staff has been happy with the relaunch, and Northeastern's Dan Kennedy says that the core reporting and criticism haven't changed. They still have that alternative edge, he says. 
Though hurt by the recession, magazines have indeed done better than newspapers, and glossy city magazines have done better still. In June and July, there were rumors that the Phoenix was being shopped to potential buyers, but Kadzis says Mindich was unable to bring himself to sell. Anyone who knows Stephen knows he's a fighter, he says. It's as simple as that. In an interview with WGBH in August, Mindich said he could not see walking away without a last attempt to turn things around. That seems to imply some finality: Either Mindich makes the new Phoenix profitable soon, or he's done. 
It won't be easy. People told me that to make money the magazine would need to boost revenue in the second half of 2012 by between 25 and 30 percent. The first issue of the redesign ran to 118 pages, but the following six issues came in at around 90, roughly a third of which were devoted to ads. That ratio, according to several people with knowledge of the Phoenix's advertising rate base and financial situation, is simply not enough to keep the company afloat. In November, when I asked Mindich via email how much time he was willing to give the new format, he replied that he was optimistic about the potential to increase revenue and did not feel a need to put in place a time frame. (And perhaps things are looking up. The November 9 issue had 110 pages.) Unlike many alt weeklies, the Phoenix has seen its circulation stay constant in recent years, at just above 100,000. At this point the response to our new format has been universally positive, Mindich wrote. And it is still early in terms of the sales cycle. 
In the past two years, in an apparent attempt to stand out, the Phoenix has become sharper and more opinionated, most notably in a series of aggressive stories on the Occupy movement by the writer Chris Faraone (who has contributed to Boston magazine in the past). One former Phoenix news editor told me that the Occupy stories would not have made the cut in the early 2000s, less for reasons of ideology than for reasons of editorial quality or newsworthiness. The Phoenix has always skewed left, but its political writing in the 1970s and 1980s was rarely strident. Marty Linsky, the Real Paper editor, told me that moving hard to the left may be one of a few remaining ways for alt weeklies to attract attention. I think, in some respects, that's the only avenue left, to be politically radical, he says. On November 1, Carioli ran an article by the former Atlantic and Globe staffer Wen Stephenson that attacked the mainstream media's coverage of global warming. Stephenson would like to see climate change covered as a crisis, not a debate. The piece was angry and polemical, and at times it read more like a pose than a genuine critique. But like Faraone's writing, it has attracted plenty of attention. 
One problem for alternative weeklies in 2012 is that their place in the modern media landscape is poorly defined. What are they now alternative to? Mainstream news organizations in the United States are far more diverse and permissive than even a decade ago, and you can find just about any alternative you want online. In substance, mainstream and alternative papers haven't been all that different for a long time. The evidence of this is how easily alt-weekly all-stars go to dailies and magazines and succeed, Jack Shafer says. They're less important the way the Boston Globe and the Washington Post are less important. It's more competition, more voices. And so the challenge is daunting for alt weeklies: less identity, less money, and nimbler competitors.
No publication should be judged strictly against the standards of a bygone era, so it's not fair to compare the glossy Phoenix of today to the classified ad-supported paper of 1980. But the differences are stark. In 2001 the Phoenix broke the Boston-clergy sex abuse scandal with a series of careful articles on Cardinal Bernard Law. And as recently as September 2002, the paper was able to run two columns in both the dance and theater departments, in addition to feature interviews with playwrights and a full complement of reporting and opinion. The magazine now appears to rely on one provocative feature per issue, along with David Bernstein's political reporting. There's no media column, no criticism longer than 450 words, and very little local reporting, especially compared with the Globe. 
When I asked Carioli about the earlier eras of the Phoenix, and how he thought it has changed, he said comparing the two is mostly pointless. I don't understand the logic, he said. Because there are many alternatives, we can't be one of them? You have to be smart about what you're good at. And the things that we're good at, I think we're better at than the competition. 
He has a point. The Phoenix's arts coverage remains better than the Globe's, and Bernstein is a fine political writer, perhaps the best in the state. So maybe the Phoenix will indeed rise again. In his response to Will Doig's Salon article in October, which seemed to take the Phoenix's end as a given, Carioli wrote that the paper has never been driven by nostalgia. So don't come in here peddling that 'disappeared' nonsense, he wrote. This isn't our first evolution, more like our fortieth, and it won't be our last.

Can this 400-pound blubber-and-fur hottie woo the ladies of the New England Aquarium? Let's hope so--his species may depend on it. 
by Chris Sweeney
Boston, meet Commander. The 7-foot-long, 11-year-old northern fur seal Â¬recently made his way from Seattle to the New England Aquarium, where scientists hope he'll hit it off with his female counterparts and sireafew pups. 
Commander isarare sight. One of nine such animals across all the aquariums and zoos in the U.S., he stands out as the one male who's old enough and big enough to put the moves on Ursula, the aquarium's only reproductively Â¬viable female. Asaspecies, northern fur seals are"incredibly underrepresented," says Patty Schilling, one of the aquarium's senior marine mammal trainers. 
Mankind hasn't made life easy for northern fur seals, whose natural habitat is in the Pribilof Islands,afew hundred miles off the coast of Alaska. The seals' impressive pelts--they have one of the thickest coats in the animal kingdom, with an Â¬astonishing 300,000 hairs per square inch--werealucrative target for hunters and trappers. By some estimates, it took onlyafew years for the revenue generated from the northern fur seal pelt trade to cover the cost of buying Alaska.
"They were hunted almost to the point of extinction," Schilling says."They were actually hunted all the way through the early 1980s, Â¬until that became illegal." The seals' population remains imperiled, and is Â¬declining by about5percent each year as overfishing and climate change trash their ecosystem. 
If Commander and Ursula knock boots, they'll be contributing much-needed genetic diversity to the Â¬existing population. Beyond that, their adorable seal pups will tug at our heartstrings, which Schilling hopes will boost conservation efforts. 
But before sparks fly at the aquarium, Commander needs to pack on the pounds to prove to Ursula that he'saprime partner Â¬capable of protecting his territory. To that end, he's eating about32pounds of fishaday, or roughly 14,000 calories. During previous mating seasons, Commander has exceeded500pounds. 
But even if he doesn't plump up toaquarter ton, he has one natural advantage when it comes to earning Ursula's affection:"He's very handsome," Schilling says withalaugh. 
The Art of (Virtual) War
by Jesse Geman
Despite the global popularity of online gaming, no one's created an official college-only league. Until now. Will Boston becomeamajor hub of the world's fastest-growing sport? 
Onafrigid february day in Newton, teams of Harvard and Boston University students battled one another on the playing field, mauling, slashing, and shooting their way to victory. But instead of jockstraps and helmets, they wore axes and magic wands, and many had taken the form of skimpily clad sorceresses or shapeshifting foxlike creatures. Yes, the action was virtual, but the competition was very real--players furiously mashed at their keyboards while shouting commands and arguing about strategy. 
Both teams are members of the brand-new American Video Game League (AVGL), launched last year by 25-year-old Victor Suski, also the founder ofastate-of-the-art e-sport venue, the Gaming Center, in Newton. 
Suski,aBentley grad withafinance degree, is capitalizing on the massive popularity of e-sports: More people watched the League of Legends world championships last year than the World Series; pro gaming is nowamedaled event at theXGames; and one of the world's largest porn sites, YouPorn, even sponsors its own"Team YP." The University of Pikeville, in Kentucky, and Robert Morris University Illinois, in Chicago, are even offering e-sports scholarships. And in August, Amazon bought the video-game-streaming site Twitch TV for $1.1 billion. 
Although an official video-game league--for the League of Legends--does offeracollege championship series, Suski says it doesn't have the same flexibility that his AVGL does:"They structure it just like the NFL would be, to the point where they literally fine teams for breaking certain rules and things like that. They're really strict." 
As for Suski's custom-built Newton venue, it features two soundproofed, five-computer booths;aviewing lounge; and an Internet broadcast facility equipped with microphones, game monitors, and feeds from wall-mounted cameras to capture and stream the gamers in action. 
Suski's goal is to make the AVGL the NCAA for college-level e-sports (thus far, seven Boston-area colleges have signed up), and to make his centeramajor hub. For five days in January, the center hosted the Evil Geniuses team as they prepared for the Dota2Asia Championship, where they won first place and $1.2 million. 
Back at the Harvardâ "BU tourney, the former loses when BU player"demonraiser112" uses his crossbow-wielding assassin to overpower his opponent inawell-timed assault. Although they lost, Harvard's team captain, sophomore Young-Jun Kim, said he was"definitely proud of the team...and I'm pumped to keep going." 
The Power of Ideas: Malia Lazu
 by S.I. Rosenbaum
With an injection of new funding, Future Boston's executive director and cofounder is diversifying Boston, one party atatime.
Culture Clash
Malia Lazu grew up in Hawaii, an ideal place to beamixed-race kid: People of color make up75percent of the population there. Lazu compares the culture of her childhood to the ubiquitous Hawaiian"plate lunch," where Â¬Korean, Â¬native Hawaiian, Portuguese, and Japanese food might shareasingle plate. When she Â¬arrived in Boston, she found that"everything is so much more black and white," she says."It's the culture. Â¬Everything is compartmentalized." 
Bad Habits
It isn't that Boston lacks diversity, Lazu says, noting that one in four people in the city speakanon-English language at home. It's just that we rarely get out of our comfort zones."People sort of stay in their communities to eat, to go to church," Lazu says."People aren't Â¬going to Eastie for Latino food, they're Â¬going for the new wine bar." Lazu hasabackground as an activist and civic organizer, butaÂ¬desire to change the city's culture was the impetus Â¬behind Future Boston,anonprofit she cofounded in2011with Greg Selkoe, CEO of the online streetwear retailer Karmaloop. 
Mixing It Up
One of Future Boston's missions is to bring the city together by making it more fun. That means everything from championing late-nightTservice and expanding liquor licenses to runningasix-month accelerator program for creative startups."Who doesn't like to dance to each other's songs, eat each other's food, and see each other's movies?" Lazu says. When Karmaloop filed for bankruptcy in March, the future of Â¬Future Boston looked dire. But Lazu got the project back on its feet with an injection of funds from the Barr Foundation and Boston Foundation. Now she's in new offices in Dudley Square. Can Boston's race issues really be healed byaseries of parties? Maybe, Lazu says withalaugh."Being naÃ¯ve is really important to do this work."

Dirty Meds
By Courtney Humphries 
Two Northeastern University scientists are hoping they've found the magic bug killer in Maine's fertile soil.
The world desperately needs new drugs. In the decades since our discovery of antibiotics, disease-causing bacteria have evolved to resist them; at least 23,000 people die in the U.S. each year due to untreatable infections. Fortunately,apair of local researchers may have found the answer right in our backyard. They've identified one potentially game-changing, resistance-proof antibiotic. And they think they've also figured outaway to find more. 
Kim Lewis, director of Northeastern University's Antimicrobial Discovery Center, has been leading the effort to findanew class of antibiotics in New England's dirt, where"microorganisms live inavery crowded environment," he says. To fight one another for territory, these soil-dwelling microbes use chemical weapons against each other--weapons that humans can theoretically harness. 
Exploring microbes for this purpose isn't revolutionary. For years, researchers have hunted for natural antibiotics by growing microbes in petri dishes and testing them for antibiotic powers. The problem with that approach is that an estimated99percent of those microorganisms cannot thrive in the lab. But Lewis and his colleague Slava Epstein,abiologist at Northeastern, have developedabreakthrough technique that allows these bacteria to flourish. 
Their method relies onasmall plastic device called the iChip, which contains hundreds of tiny holes. Those holes are then covered with thin membranes dotted with pores that allow chemicals to pass in and out. When the iChip is dipped into liquid fromasoil sample, each hole capturesabacterial cell. The device is then put back into dirt, and the bacteria continue getting the nutrients they need."Essentially, you trick them," Lewis says. The microbes grow as if they're in their native environment. Onceacell formsalarge colony inside the chip, researchers can test whether they release any chemicals that kill disease-causing bugs like Staphylococcus aureas (staph). 
Lewis and Epstein cofounded Cambridge's NovoBiotic Pharmaceuticals in 2003, where they've used this approach to cultivate tens of thousands of strains of bacteria. Thus far, they've discovered25new antibiotics. But the latest, teixobactin, is unusual--in laboratory tests, common pathogens didn't mutate to resist it, as would be expected. Lewis and Epstein believe teixobactin attacks parts of bacteria that don't evolve, findings they published in Nature this January. 
What kind ofabug produces suchapowerful weapon? Teixobactin came fromapreviously unknown bacterium, which Lewis speculates may beapredator that kills and eats other microbes. And he's optimistic that there are many more such killers out there. 
It could take years to turn the compound, which came from soil inagrassy Maine field, intoamarketable drug. In the meantime, Lewis and Epstein's work promises to help reinvigorate the hunt for new, life-saving drugs. 
The Truth Is Out There
 By Michelle Marino
Since the late '60s, members of the Reed family of Sheffield have claimed they were abducted by aliens. When the Great Barrington Historical Society & Museum inducted their stories earlier this year, it became the first"mainstream" American historical society or museum to recognize an encounter asahistorical fact. Below, three additional Massachusetts tales that make you wonder.
Muddy River,1639
James Everell observedaflaming light in the sky above the Muddy River in what is now the Back Bay. The light stood still, flared up, and then transformed"into the figure ofaswine." 
South Ashburnham,1967
Betty Andreasson says that aliens beamedared light into her house, then escorted her to their mother craft (communicating telepathically) while the rest of her family stood by in suspended animation. 
Billerica,2004
Robert and Anne (no last name given) say that an Â¬illuminated flying object Â¬approached their house, and then emittedapale blue light beam that formedasquare on the deck, levitating Anne as Robert tried to pull her back to Earth.
The Big Score 
By S. I. Rosenbaum
Local opera phenom Matthew Aucoin's world premiere at the American Repertory Theater will tell you everything you need to know about the future of classical music.
A recent Wall Street Journal headline screamed:"Is Matthew Aucoin the Next Leonard Bernstein?" Perhaps, but this past winter, the composer was nowhere near the limelight."I've been living inside the cave that is the opera," he said via phone. 
Aucoin was laboring over the opera he'll debut this month at the A.R.T., Crossing , based on the diary Walt Whitman kept while working inahospital's charnel house during the Civil War."Composing is like, 'Sit alone inaroom and suffer,'" he joked. The 25-year-old prodigy from Medfield, who began writing symphonies in middle school, studied poetry at Harvard before serving as assistant conductor for the New York Metropolitan Opera Company's luminous2012production of Thomas Adès's The Tempest . Aucoin impressed the Met by memorizing parts of the treacherously difficult score beforehand. 
Crossing will be the first full staging of an Aucoin opera, but hardly the last."It's the most raw, physical, primal, intimate, and rich art form thatIknow," said Aucoin, the Peabody Essex Museum's first composer in residence."I'm saying that as someone who's played inarock band." 
May 4, 2015: Composer Matthew Aucoin's opera is called"Crossing," not"The Crossing." Also, he is"Matthew," not"Matt." We regret the error. 
Members Only

Boston's private social clubs have thrived on Brahmin privilege for generations. In anticipation of our engraved invitation (maybe it got lost in the mail?), we've shopped all the options.
1. The Harvard Club of Boston
374 Commonwealth Ave.
Founded: 1908
Details: Open to Harvard alums, employees, and their relatives, the club does offer entry to anyone (sansaHarvard Â¬degree) willing to drop up to $6 million on one of its new condos, built to financearecent renovation. 
Classic moment: Dick Cheney had to sneak in through the back door foraspeaking engagement in2006due to the throngs of protesters. 
2. The Algonquin Club
217 Commonwealth Ave.
Founded: 1888
Details: Like Fight Club, if you're in Â¬Algonquin, you don't talk about Algonquin. Word is the mortgage was burned long ago and its ashes were placed inatiny box next to the main fireplace in the reading room.
Presidential power: Calvin Coolidge.
Pretend power: Clark Rockefeller. 
3. St. Botolph Club
199Commonwealth Ave.
Founded: 1880
Details: Founded for black-sheep bluebloods (those moody creative types), the club's foundation gives away approximately $75,000ayear in grants to young New England musicians, painters, poets, and writers. 
Artistic bona fides: The roster includes John Quincy Adams, John Singer Sargent, and Robert Frost. 
4. The College Club of Boston

Taking the Plunge
Boston, 1985.
Boston's private social clubs have thrived on Brahmin privilege for generations. In anticipation of our engraved invitation (maybe it got lost in the mail?), we've shopped all the options. 
"It was unusually warm--89 degrees on Saturday, May 11, 1985, as the Farmer's Almanac refreshed my memory. Back then, it was common to see groups of kids cooling off by jumping off the Dorchester Bay Bridge on Morrissey Boulevard. The cool ocean water below wasadaring plunge, but usuallyasafe one. This day, it was very important to finda"hot weather feature" for the Globe 's Sunday paper, soIremember how luckyIwas to findalarge group of kids Â¬leaping off the bridge. 
There wasabunch of them jumping from the railing atop the bridge, but the only wayIwas going to get the photo was to go to the other side of Morrissey Boulevard, and walk along the sand and shoot underneath the bridge as they jumped. 
I guess it was perfect timing to get all six kids jumping together; one girl is just about to touch the water with her feet. 
I wonder where those kids are now,30years later."

The Guardian of Concord
New England's next great memoirist explores the high cost of living on our quaint revolutionary roads.
By Eugenia Williamson
Most of us think of Concord asaRevolutionary War battleground, the cradle of American literature, or the quintessence of affluent New England charm--a place where even the Dunkin' Donuts hasabrass-on-cream sign. But the novelist Sarah Payne Stuart thinks of her hometown asakind of New England Puritan Disneyland, with all the bombast, artifice, and manufactured happiness that suchadesignation implies.
"How can any child go wrong when they grew up in this happy little town?" Payne says, on the phone from her current home in Maine."You just can't believe they'd become murderers or homeless or anything like that...but of course they do."
Stuart's upcoming memoir, Perfectly Miserable, is an acidic, hilarious, and monumentally self-deprecating account of its author's doomed love affair with the world's quaintest town. After an idyllic 1950s childhood traipsing through the woods immortalized by Louisa May Alcott and Henry David Thoreau, Stuart began to chafe against Concord's manic wholesomeness in her teenage years. She becameahippie and took off, eventually landing in New York. But when she became pregnant with her third child, Stuart felt her hometown's primal call. She left behind her advertising career and moved back, hoping to give her children the sublime upbringing only Concord could deliver.
And that, you might say, is where the trouble began. In Perfectly Miserable--which began asa2012 piece for the New Yorker--she writes frankly about her and her husband's real estate folie Ã  deux, which involved tradinganice house forahome in Concord's most exclusive neighborhood at the precise moment his business went south, then selling that property when they could no longer afford the mortgage."The whole point of beingaNew Englander is that you want people to approve of what you are," she says. Life in Concord may seem perfect,"but there's always this sense you're not measuring up. You're constantly being judged."
"Concord has always beenahaven for people screwed up about money," she writes in the book. This generalization includes herself, as well as her own family,agroup of neurotic bluebloods with ever-dwindling trust funds. Stuart writes unsparingly about the blithe flashiness of the super-rich, new-money types taking over the town. But she was most anxious about outing her deliberately shabby WASP neighbors as the multimillionaires they are."I was really nervous about it, because people who have old money don't want anyone to know they have any money," she says."But thenIgotaletter from the Land Trust saying, 'You're the guardian of Concord.'"
When Stuart set out to write her newest book, she envisionedahistorical account of Concord's famous authors, their families, and their dealings with the town. She reread Emerson. She became an expert on Thoreau. ("He's not that great," she says, but she did rent his house foraspell.) Stuart was particularly taken with Louisa May Alcott's sad and impoverished Concord childhood, spent coping with the outsize personalities of her parents, Amos Bronson Alcott (likely bipolar) and the long-suffering Abigail May, known to Little Women fans as Marmee, whom Stuart considers the"most disapproving woman of all time."
But Stuart's editor deemed her original idea"too New England" and encouraged the author to write about herself. Still, these long-dead heavyweights castalong shadow over Perfectly Miserable, providingaguiding spirit in Concord even now."To this day in Concord, Marmees still bound from the bushes," she writes."These were the matriarchs of my youth,alandscape of cherished but not always cherishing women--mending their swimsuits, buying gingerly at the Aâ  &â  P, holding up the bank line with their satchels of rolled pennies, attacking the lawn with broken bamboo rakes."
Stuart's memoir serves in part asaeulogy to this militantly unassuming way of life: The Marmees, now in their nineties, are being pushed aside."It was old money that settled Concord--rich, rich, miserable, masochistic Puritans with so much money...and they gave it away and they were ashamed of it," she says."WhenIwas growing up, you had no idea who had money. They looked very similar, and you just didn't know. The houses were really shabby. People went to public school. Nobody had help. But it really has changed."
Things started to shift right around the time she and her husband moved intoafixer-upper in the elite neighborhood Nashawtuc Hill, where"the money was so established and well bred you never heard its rustle." Amid the"dog-walking women in shapeless, comfortable clothes and men's boots" sprung up ostentatious new homes built by people who"came from everywhere but New England and were blissfully unaware of its shabby-genteel mandates.... The owners of the new houses actually seemed to enjoy living in them."
But not Stuart, not anymore: These days, the Guardian of Concord lives in northern Maine and New York City. From this remote vantage, she sees Perfectly Miserable as an ambivalent farewell to the town of her dreams."I weep every timeIsay goodbye to Concord," she says,"but my husband says we're not allowed back."

The Cruelty of Reality
At Harvard, meet the lab that's creatinganew kind of cinema.
By Peter Keough
Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab is hard to find. An interdisciplinary program scattered about the university, it is nowhere in particular and everywhere in general: Its minuscule staff and handful of students draw on the resources of the Harvard Film Archive, the Film Study Center, and the Anthropology Department. As Stephanie Spray, co-director of their newest film, Manakamana (which opens in Boston in April or May), jokingly puts it, it's"in the cloud."
You could almost say that SEL is not so muchaplace asastate of mind that fuses scientific objectivity and an almost spiritual faith in the power of film. And yet the laboratory has formulatedaferocious new documentary style that is transforming nonfiction filmmaking, and maybe cinema itself.
Take SEL's last release, Leviathan (2012), directed by the anthropologist Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Véréna Paravel. The camera's eye descends into the maw ofaNew Bedford fishing vessel as it sucks up and processes sea life. The filmmakers shoot from wherever their GoPro cameras can find access: underwater, between the legs of fishermen, upside down staring into the abstract patterns of angry seagulls, or eye to eye withadeck full of sloshing, half-dead marine creatures.
They edited the resulting footage into87kaleidoscopic minutes, set againstapalpable, near-painful soundtrack orchestrated by SEL co-director and sound specialist Ernst Karel. The experience ranges from serene, psychedelic Escher-like patterns to the cinematic equivalent of waterboarding.
SEL was founded in2006by Castaing-Taylor, and in some ways its approach resembles conventional ethnographic filmmaking: For Leviathan, Paravel tells me via email, she and Castaing-Taylor"went out on six trips, foratotal of perhaps two andahalf months at sea...and ended up with around300hours of rushes." At the same time, though, the SEL technique draws on the subjectivity of first-person documentaries--but without the filmmaker appearing on camera. Most important, it leaves out an element common to both of those nonfiction approaches: language.
Despite, or because of, this, Leviathan didarespectable run in art houses and later on DVD and Blu-ray discs. It was successful enough for Hollywood studios to contact them to find out how they'd achieved their effects.
So far, though, SEL has made its biggest impression on critics, scholars, and cinephiles. The films have gotten rave reviews, won festival prizes, and appeared on the year-end lists of publications including the New York Times and the New Yorker . And in April and May, SEL productions will be featured simultaneously in Lincoln Center's"Art of the Real" program and at the Whitney Biennial. Says Lincoln Center program director Dennis Lim,"These films have already been influential in expanding many people's ideas of whatadocumentary could be. My guess is that Leviathan in particular will come to be seen as one of the most influential films of our time."
Castaing-Taylor, for his part, finds all the fuss embarrassing."I think it's stupid," he says of the hype."They're always on the lookout for some new fashion."
We're sitting in an SEL studio inamodest building on the fringes of the Harvard campus. It consists of three rooms, one of which is full of computers and editing equipment. No one is using them at the moment.
On the coffee table next to us restsaplastic model ofahuman brain besideabook on Chernobyl.Apainting ofacarcass (Untitled, from Maxwell's Lair, by Emilie Clark) dominates one wall. On another wall hangsahorse's skull punctured byabullet hole,asouvenir of Castaing-Taylor's days making Sweetgrass (2009),afilm aboutasheep roundup in Montana that he co-directed with Ilisa Barbash.Awhiff of incense lingers, perhaps sandalwood.
Genial and bearded withaLiverpool accent, the fortyish Castaing-Taylor asks to be quoted not at all, or as little as possible. He doesn't want to be the center of attention.
We talk for more than an hour. He explains how, unlike most ethnographic documentaries that try"to express in propositional prose the sense of the infinite magnitude of human existence that can't be transcribed," their films try to move beyond voice-overs and talking heads to confront raw existence.
For his next project, Castaing-Taylor is makingafeature combining fiction and nonfiction."It's about sex and cannibalism," he says."What is more basic to human existence than sexual desire?" 
Cannibalism?Iask. He points out how cannibalism has beenaprominent topic in the history of anthropology, though mostly the ritualistic kind practiced in non-Western cultures. But he is more interested in"sexual cannibalism," the modern, consensual kind in which people advertise on websites for someone to have sex with them and then eat them."It happened in Germany," he says, adding,"It's illegal."
BeforeIleave he insists thatItalk with other SEL members. They are more articulate, he says. And don't mind being quoted.
I had already called on Stephanie Spray, who is on campus. We talk inaquiet office in Sever Hall's Film Study Center.
I had just seen her film Manakamana. Where Leviathan assaults, Manakamana soothes. But both challenge the viewer.
The premise is deceptively simple. In Nepal, Spray and her collaborator Pacho Velez make trips inacable car with pilgrims to the shrine of the title deity. The film consists of single takes fromafixed camera facing the other passengers, each shot running the entire 10-minute trip to the temple. Then they do the same withadifferent party going back again. Each trip, back or forth, ends in the din and darkness of the station.
It's like riding the Green Line and spying on people, wondering about their lives. Every gesture and glance takes on significance and mystery. Here you're doing the same when, bang, the darkness comes, and it starts again.
I ask Spray,"Is thisametaphor for death and rebirth?"
"Samsara," she agrees."It's an attempt to touch the real. Not that there is any absolute." 
On the deskInotice the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, the film critic James Agee's collaboration with the photographer Walker Evans, an account of their eight-week sojourn with Alabama sharecroppers during the Depression. It's required reading for SEL students.
"It's our bible," Castaing-Taylor says whenIask him about it. He quotes from the book:"'The cruel radiance of what is.' That's our goal. To get away from the conventions that constrain and prettify film and to get back to the cruelty of reality."

The Good, the Bad, and the Lake Street Dive
Davids Letterman and Remnick may love them to death, but America's newest roots-pop sensations are still Bostonians at heart.
By Maura Johnston
It'sacold February Friday in Harvard Square, but inside the Sinclair, on Church Street, the room is ablaze. The capacity crowd is here to celebrate the Boston-bred band Lake Street Dive's second album, Bad Self Portraits (Signature Sounds), and it'sakind of reunion--these fans have been with Lake Street Dive since the beginning.
"I think all of us have loved playing in Boston, but especially now," says bassist Bridget Kearney, whose skill on the upright gives the group's live show extra swagger."[Our] new audience knows us foracertain small window of our band history, and going back to Boston, there are people in the house who know all of our first songs from10years ago. So that's awesome."
Ah, yes, that"new audience." Lake Street Dive--Kearney, vocalist Rachael Price, trumpeter/guitarist Mike"McDuck" Olson, and drummer Mike Calabrese--have experienced quite the whirlwind over the past two years. Though they've been together since the early 2000s--they met while attending the New England Conservatory of Music--their big break came in 2012, whenavideo of the band standing onaBrighton street corner becameaYouTube sensation, as did the covers-heavy EP, Fun Machine, that accompanied it. That video--a sultry, single-mike cover of the Jackson 5's"I Want You Back," with lightly brushed drums, upright bass, trumpet, and the group's devil's-food-cake harmonies--sums upalot of Lake Street Dive's appeal, placing their conservatory training at the front in an almost modest way that didn't overshadow the song's fundamental melodic appeal. 
"The central reason why we call ourselvesa'pop band,' and what appeals to us [about] pop music, is the immediacy of it--the visceral appeal," Kearney says."We're not trying to make music that is fundamentally super-challenging to listen to. That's not the first goal for us. We want to make music that people are going to enjoy, and that's going to be pop...ular." She laughs.
T-Bone Burnett was one of the people who took notice of the band's alchemical abilities, and he invited the band to play at New York's Town Hall last September as part of the"Another Day, Another Time" concert. The show, which celebrated the Coen Brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis, hadaton of Big Appleâ "based tastemakers in attendance--including New Yorker editor David Remnick andaLetterman booker. Lake Street Dive laid downaperformance of"You Go Down Smooth,"aswinging Bad Self Portraits track about being drunk on bad love, and the raves rolled in."Amy Winehouse by way of Michael Jackson," Remnick called it--an assessment that's in line with the band's pop outlook. 
"We're influenced by pop music fromabunch of different eras," Kearney says."One of the things people hear most in it is some of the more retro pop music we're into--the Beatles, Motown. That's definitely some of our favorite music to listen to, so it makes sense that those sounds would be present in our music. But we're also intoabunch of current music--Beck, the Dirty Projectors, Rubblebucket." 
Bad Self Portraits splits the difference amongahandful of classic pop idioms. Price's velvety voice has just enough grit--and the arrangements are just crisp enough--for Lake Street Dive to do double duty at cocktail bars and rock clubs. Each member hasahand in writing the skeletons of songs (Kearney, for example, wrote the heartbroken title track), but the band's workshopping process involves collectively arranging both the track and--crucially--the vocal harmonies, which curl underneath Price's enigmatic purr in ways that make them sound plush."I think that addsacoherence toacollection of songs that are written by four different people," Kearney notes. 
After playing toaseries of sold-out crowds across America this spring, Lake Street Dive will come back to Boston forashow at Royale,asprawling downtown palace that's quiteaways from the band's scruffier beginnings."We did some of our first shows at Toad, in Cambridge," Kearney recalls."It's justaperfect, tiny dive bar where we learned how to beaband. Now that we're playing bigger venues,Isometimes imagine myself still in Toad to get into the right place. Toad and the Losers' Lounge and Club Passim were the clubs in Boston that really took us under their wing when we were first getting started, and we're so grateful to the people who run those spots."
On that Friday in Cambridge, gratitude flowed back and forth--the audience sang along with Lake Street Dive's originals and covers, while the band declared from the stage that it still considered Boston its hometown. Later on, after the bar closed, the band would make its Late Show with David Letterman debut. They threw downaperformance of Bad Self Portraits' title track that caused the notoriously sardonic Letterman to ask them if they'd be interested in coming back"every night--can you do that?" Given Lake Street Dive's increasingly tight schedule, the residency offer probably wouldn't work out. But the idea of them bringing something new to the Ed Sullivan Theater stage night after night isn't too farfetched.

Pop
Festivals, homecomings, and triumphs of"local losers" help Boston thaw afteralong, cold winter.
By Maura Johnston
The Both, The Both (SuperEgo, out April 15)
In 2012, Ted Leo and Boston new-wave icon Aimee Mann toured together and later began collaborating as #Both. They've since dropped the hashtag from their name and recordedabriskly smart, self-titled full-length. The combination of Mann's precise songcraft and Leo's punk-honed chops isadelight; The Both is crisp and wry, full of well-appointed pop songs in which Mann's sullen, muscular alto providesagrounding counterpoint to Leo's rich tenor. Bonus: Their onstage rapport should be in even finer form by the time they hit Boston in April. 4/25, Paradise Rock Club,967Commonwealth Ave., Boston, the-both.com. 
Pile,"Special Snowflakes" (Exploding in Sound)
You know you're making waves when other bands are writing songs about you. Earlier this year, local noise-pop outfit Krill put out"Steve Hears Pile in Malden and Bursts into Tears,"avalentine of sorts to the effects of this quartet's shoulder-shaking, scene-beloved rock. Even Pile's slower jams inspire -aggressive moshing: the lead song from their new single,"Special Snowflakes," trades quiet guitar interludes with screamy freakouts until it screeches toahalt. It'll turn Great Scott intoacombination mosh pit/ballet studio. 3/30, Great Scott,1222Commonwealth Ave., Boston, pile.bandcamp.com. 
 New England Metal & Hardcore Festival" 
This three-day, two-stage salute to face-melting metal and hardcore goes up for the 16th time in mid-April. Springfield metalcore outfit All That Remains headline day one, while renowned Boston hardcore metallurgists Sam Black Church--reuniting for their third performance of the 21st century--anchor the local offerings. 4/17â "4/19, the Palladium,261Main St., Worcester, metalandhardcorefestival.com.

Mean Creek, Local Losers
(Old Flame, out April 8) The latest album by this feisty four-piece is the best recording to date of the undeniable energy the group brings to its raved-about live sets--imagine Springsteen headliningabasement show. The vocal interplay between Chris Keene and Aurore Ounjian is particularly arresting on the hungry"Johnny Allen," while Kevin Macdonald's strident bass playing providesasolid yet pleasantly loose anchor. 4/25, the Middle East, 472â "480 Massachusetts Ave., Cambridge, 617-864-3278. 
Slaine, The King of Everything Else (Suburban Noize, out June 24)
Depicting Boston's hard-knock life on record and in film (he played the heavy in Ben -Affleck's Gone Baby Gone and The Town) comes naturally for this MC, who's been rapping since he was nine years old. Darkness dominates his work, although he did tell the news site HipHopDX that his next album--the hyper-autobiographical The King of Everything Else--will be lighter, like"a combination of Hunter S. Thompson and Chris Farley."
"Boston Calling"
The third installment of Boston's big downtown festival isalittle bigger: It now runs Friday to Sunday. Early-aughts indie titans Modest Mouse and Death Cab for Cutie headline the weekend days, joined by practiced festival hands such as Hawaiian strummer Jack Johnson, heart-rending Long Islanders Brand New, and sisterly duo Tegan and Sara, not to mention new kids like Bastille and the Neighbourhood. 5/23â "5/25, City Hall Plaza, bostoncalling.com. 
 Eli"Paperboy" Reed, Nights Like This 
(Warner Bros., out April 29) Brookline-bred, Mississippi-taught retroist Eli"Paperboy" Reed gave Bostonapeek at his forthcoming album, Nights Like This, when he played the Sinclair this past Valentine's Day. The frantic"Woo Hoo" shows off his falsetto and ability to turnawordless phrase into an incitement foraparty; "Shock to the System" (co-written with Fitz & the Tantrums' Michael Fitzpatrick) splits the difference between Sam & Dave and Bruno Mars. elipaperboyreed.com.

The Church of Zander
Nearly sunk by scandal two years ago, the conductor is back foravigorous second act.
By Zak Jason
Onarecent afternoon, Benjamin Zander stood at the prow of117musicians--the oldest barely legal to drink--and drove them into the stormy heart of Mahler's Symphony No. 5. Zander growled, roared, and barked from the podium, drenched in sweat, dabbing himself withabath towel dangling from his music stand every few minutes. Then he slashed the air with his baton, and the orchestra came toafull stop.
"This moment isawild, terrifying tango of death," he intoned in his British accent, addressing two pubescent clarinetists."Can you play that again with more cojones?"
This scene would have seemed unlikely, if not impossible, two years ago. In 2012, Benjamin Zander's career looked like it was kaput:Ascandal had cost him his 45-year reign asapedagogical deity at the New England Conservatory, and it seemed the conductor would simply fade into ignominy.
Yet here he is, on the cusp of 75, more vigorous than ever. Not only is he helminganew youth orchestra, but he is also leading the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra into its 35th season--playing Symphony Hall on April25and holdingacelebratory gala the following night. On the side, he's performing and guest-conducting with orchestras from Virginia to Malaysia, and giving motivational speeches to corporate executives. It'sasecond movement no one could have predicted--except those who know him well.
"The wounds are still open," says his former wife and close friend, Rosamund Zander."But he doesn't visit them. Ben doesn't spend time doing pointed work on himself; he's out there in the public."
Born two years after his Jewish parents fled Berlin, Zander dropped out of high school at15and trained asacellist under the Spanish virtuoso Gaspar CassadÃ". He came to Boston in1964onaHarkness Commonwealth Fellowship to study at Harvard and Brandeis and wound up at NEC, where he cofounded and developed NEC's partnership with the Walnut Hill School for the Arts. He took the program from seven students to 90, and transformedafledgling youth ensemble into an orchestra that brought connoisseur audiences from Brazil to China to tears.
"You could try to temper him, but it wouldn't happen," says longtime BPO cellist Armenne Derderian."Especially with the kids, he's incredibly dramatic. He wantsaholy explosion of fabulous music, full commitment, for you to sink yourself into the music inaway no other conductor demands." 
Former NEC student and current BPO violinist Joshua Peckins says,"He treated all of us like real musicians and real humans."
Zander's downfall came in early 2012. At the time,ascandal was unfolding at Penn State--after former football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was indicted for decades of raping children, 46-year head coach Joe Paterno was fired in November2011for failing to fully report his knowledge of the abuse. This set the backdrop for the NEC administration's discovery thatavideographer Zander had hired to tape the youth orchestra's rehearsals wasaconvicted child rapist. Worse, that Zander had known about the conviction before hiring him, and had even written character testimony for the man at his sentencing in 1993.
NEC president Tony Woodcock had no great love for Zander; the previous summer he had forced the conductor to agree that he would retire in 2013. Armed with the new information, Woodcock fired Zander outright on January 12, 2012. Reactions were polarized. Students picketed an NEC benefit and wroteapetition for his reinstatement. Many companies canceled his motivational speeches. Some pundits excused his behavior; other cited his"breathtaking irresponsibility."
"Nobody gained from that," Zander says fromaseat beside his fireplace, where above the mantel sitsabumper sticker that reads:Apositive attitude may not solve all of your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort."AndIdon't blame anybody. It was the atmosphere of the time. Everybody was so sensitive. If they thought it outalittle more deeply...â  " He pauses there. That's all he wants to say on record.
But Zander hasahistory of snatching victory from defeat. For example, the board of the amateur Civic Symphony Orchestra of Boston fired him in1979for going against their edict of performing more contemporary American music. Instead, he'd persistently scheduled masterworks of Mahler, Beethoven, and Dvorak."It was becoming the Ben Zander orchestra and not the Civic Symphony," one of the board's vice presidents told the Globe. Days later, however, every CSO musician joined Zander in founding the semiprofessional BPO, the group that has made him one of the world's top Mahler interpreters. 
And again, in the late 1980s, as his marriage to Rosamund fell apart, the pair agreed to attend the Landmark Forum--a three-day seminar popular among corporate executives but often lampooned in the media for its hokey insistence that participants disclose their deepest feelings. The seminar did not save their marriage, but it transformed their relationship."Rather than getting lawyers to destroy each other, we created this new world," Zander says. Together they wrote the self-help book The Art of Possibility (2000). Zander still preaches its message on the public-speaking circuit, where he has also becomeacult figure. Today, he and Rosamund live separately, but her landscape paintings fill the walls of his home, and they speak every day.
This time, as the scandal unfolded and Zander sheltered from reporters, Rosamund and NEC colleagues in his corner convinced him to start the tuition-free Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra,a"possibility organization" that shapes both musicianship and interpersonal philosophy. He held auditions in his home. More than two dozen students fled NEC. In all170tried out, and Zander brought on 117. They met for the first timeayear andahalf ago and debuted in November2012withanearly sold-out and rave-reviewed performance of Strauss's Ein Heldenleben in Symphony Hall.
Zander begins every Saturday BPYO rehearsal withawhimsical assignment such as"Feelaspring in your step" or"Fail with spirit" and gives each young musicianablank sheet of paper to reflect on their musical and personal growth or struggles, reflections Zander often posts on the BPYO Facebook page. Since their founding, they've performed at the Concertgebouw, in Amsterdam, and at Carnegie Hall,aperformance the New York Times called"brilliantly played, fervently felt."
Zander's omnipresence has also maintained his semiprofessional BPO asaserious competitor to the 133-year-old, $413-million-endowed Boston Symphony Orchestra--this in an age when most American cities strain to keepasingle ensemble alive. He pumps funds from his possibility seminars into the BPO."I'm the Robin Hood of classical music," he says. He'saconsummate marketer: While most conductors save their energy backstage, Zander cackles with patrons in the lobby and presents deeply researched and lyrical preconcert talks. Zander often says,"My definition of success is not wealth, fame, or power. It's how many shining eyes are around me."
Retirement is not on the horizon."He'sateenager in many ways, avoiding structure, avoiding settling down," says BPYO artistic adviser and former NEC dean Mark Churchill."I'll give him another20or25years, no question."
When that happens, what will become of his orchestras?"It's almost impossible to imagine the BPO without him," Peckins says."It wouldn't be the BPO without Ben," Schwartz says.
Back at rehearsal, Zander let the Mahler proceed forafew bars, and then cut offawoodwind solo."Here, you're searching," he said, clasping his hand, as if catchingafly without squashing it, and looked up at the 40-foot ceiling.
"Searching for some truth that you don't know where to find." When the flutists played it back, the phrase became less robotic and much more inquisitive, human.
"Ha!" he shouted as they continued.
"I'm going to spend the rest of my life here," Zander said duringabreak."They'll take me off the stage and intoabox."

Caped Creators
By day, they're some of our most talented painters, sculptors, and mixed-media virtuosos. By night (actually, one late afternoon on the Southie waterfront), Boston's self-appointed Superheroes of Art turn themselves into masked warriors, out to avenge a New Yorker's put-down and win the city's creative scene the respect it deserves. By Matthew Reed Baker/Photographs by Tanit Sakakini
&nbsp
Our story begins last fall at a Manhattan art gallery, where sculptor Brian Burkhardt was enjoying the opening of a show featuring his work. A New York artist asked where he was based. "Boston," said Burkhardt. The Gothamite rolled his eyes. "Oh yeah? Where's that?"
It was an attitude Burkhardt had faced before, but this time he'd had enough. At that moment, amiable sculptor gave way to avenging spirit, and a mission to defend the Boston arts scene was born.
"The idea was that superheroes were always from Gotham City," Burkhardt says. "That was the place where people would hear that the action was happening, and it's the case in the art world as well." So he vowed to gather his own kind of crusaders: a team of spandex-clad Picassos, with Boston as the unmistakable backdrop for their exploits. Burkhardt and photographer Tanit Sakakini recruited 16 of their peers to join them in the Superheroes Project, a campaign to boost awareness of and support for the city's arts community. Some members are known locally, others internationally, their work selling anywhere from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. What they all have in common is a commitment to making their careers here--and beating back any "second-tier city" sniping.
The Superheroes made their public debut in August with an unabashedly campy photo shoot at a Seaport District warehouse. Dressed as their favorite X-Men, Avengers, or Super Friends, the artists assembled for an iconic group portrait (as well as the photos on these pages); the final image will be unveiled October 23 at the Mills Gallery and sold as posters and limited-edition prints.
Revenue from those sales will help fund further Superheroes efforts, including the expansion of their website (thesuperheroesproject.com) into a portal for the Boston arts scene, with news and links to shows and artists' sites. But maybe more than anything, the goal is to give local work a higher profile at shows here and abroad. To that end, the Superheroes will strike at the core of the international market by attending Art Basel Miami Beach en masse (and in costume) in December.
Despite its origins, Burkhardt stresses the Superheroes Project is not an anti-New York campaign, nor even just about Boston, but a celebration of artists everywhere. In fact, he dreams of spawning imitators: "We're hoping other cities get on board and start some sort of rivalry. Somebody else could touche us and do the Legion of Doom--that would be beautiful."
&nbsp
Pixnit/Batgirl
Medium: Painting, street art. Pixnit is best known for her "spores," intricate floral and ornamental designs that she stencils on buildings around the city.
Real-life exploits: Her large-scale paintings on more-traditional surfaces (paper, canvas) were shown this year at the Scope art fair in Basel, Switzerland.
Origin story: "Batgirl was Barbara Gordon, daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon. I like the irony, since street art is illegal."
&nbsp
Brian Burkhardt/Professor X
Medium: Mixed media, sculpture. Burkhardt's work is an eccentric mix of the natural and the artificial: foxglove stems that end in FireWire cable plugs, a mushroom that springs from a telephone cord.
Real-life exploits: Along with fellow Superheroes Andrew Mowbray and Evelyn Rydz, he was named one of the Globe's "10 Artists to Watch" last year.
Origin story: "Being one of the initial ringleaders of this project, I thought Professor X was appropriate, in that he gathered amazing humans with special powers to work together as a team."
&nbsp
Tanit Sakakini/Firebird
Medium: Photography, film. A commercial and fine-art photographer, Sakakini calls on her background in theater to create narrative-driven portraits.
Real-life exploits: She has shot fashion and celebrity portraits for local and national magazines, including Boston.
Origin story: "Firebird's imagination and sense of belief appeal to me. Some evil aliens told her that her abilities weren't real--they were just the result of toxic waste from an experiment--but she continued to believe in her supernatural powers."
&nbsp
Cristi Rinklin/Elasti-Girl
Medium: Painting, mixed media, installation. Instead of using traditional sketches, Rinklin paints from images she has digitally manipulated into strange, plasmatic shapes.
Real-life exploits: Her work has been shown in galleries from San Francisco to Rome; she'll also have a solo exhibit at the South End's Rhys Gallery next fall.
Origin story: "A lot of abstract elements in my work appear to expand from the center of the painting and invade the viewer's space, or crawl across the space in a way that defies physics. Elasti-Girl is a perfect metaphor for this. She's organic, yet has the powers of a synthetic substance."
&nbsp
Matthew Nash/Aquaman
Medium: Video, photography, new media.
Real-life exploits: Nash and his creative partner, Jason Dean, have been working together for 15 years as the interactive-video duo Harvey Loves Harvey. Nash is also the publisher of Big Red & Shiny, a Boston arts webzine.
Origin story: "Most of my creative projects are collaborations, and Aquaman is a good collaborator. He is part of the Super Friends but rarely needed--unless someone is drowning and needs a dolphin summoned."
&nbsp
Jane D. Marsching/Rogue
Medium: Mixed media. Marsching is now working on a multimedia project called Arctic Listening Post, about climate change and human impact in that region.
Real-life exploits: She was a finalist for the ICA's prestigious Foster Prize last year, along with Sheila Gallagher and Rachel Perry Welty.
Origin story: "Rogue can fly, which is the one superpower I'd really want to have."
&nbsp
Deb Todd Wheeler/The Dazzler
Medium: Sculpture, new media. Through the 19th century-inspired machines she constructs, Wheeler explores how science affects our society. In "Live Experiments in Human Energy Exchange," her recent Green Street Gallery exhibit, volunteers powered the installation by riding a bicycle.
Real-life exploits: Her Ludicrum was featured at BU's Photographic Resource Center as part of this spring's Boston Cyberarts Festival.
Origin story: "Most of the time, I am pretty reserved and shy, so I enthusiastically chose a superhero that is my opposite: a 1980s disco queen with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams."
&nbsp
Evelyn Rydz/She-Hulk
Medium: Drawing, painting, installation, sound. Bearing such titles as Magnetic Fields and Intertidal Overflow, Rydz's dense line drawings suggest biological hybrids of the fantastic and the everyday.
Real-life exploits: One of 12 New England artists selected for the 2006 DeCordova Annual Exhibition, Rydz is showing her "In an Instant" series at Rhys Gallery through 10/5.
Origin story: "I decided to be Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk because I was interested in the idea of her being a lawyer who defended other superheroes. I also liked that she could not always control her emotions and might turn green in the middle of work."
&nbsp
Nick Rodrigues/Thor
Medium: Sculpture, mixed media, performance. Rodrigues plays with the ways that technology and innovation can alter human interaction, whether he's constructing a massive "diePod" MP3-player tombstone or wearing "Automotive Armor," a truck chassis/mask, to the grocery store.
Real-life exploits: Rodrigues, who exhibits at Rhys Gallery later this month, mentors a team of teen sculptors producing commissioned work at the South Boston nonprofit Artists for Humanity.
Origin story: "I picked Thor due to our strong similarity in haircuts. And we both work with hammers."
&nbsp
Joe Wardwell/Captain America
Medium: Painting, drawing, music. Wardwell incorporates baroque detail and heavy-metal rock gods into his paintings, some of which are guitar-shaped.
Real-life exploits: He has exhibited solo at the Green Street Gallery in Jamaica Plain and at the Allston Skirt Gallery.
Origin story: "Captain America is an interesting character since he is both superhero and something of a propaganda image. He was killed off this year, and I think that's particularly relevant, considering he was created during the WWII era as a patriotic symbol, fighting alongside the Allied troops."
&nbsp
Samantha Fields/Supergirl
Medium: Sculpture, installation. Employing curtains, furniture, and other domestic items and images, Fields focuses on the home as a stage for the different roles people play.
Real-life exploits: Fields's creations were featured last summer in Boston Art Windows, showcasing local artwork in Downtown Crossing retail spaces.
Origin story: "I've always liked the idea of an alter ego, being able to be someone else.... Even as an adult I would tell people I had superpowers in my hair--and the powers would change every time my hair color did."
&nbsp
Sheila Gallagher/Catwoman
Medium: Mixed media, installation, video. Gallagher's media is more mixed than most, with paintings made from smoke, large-scale flower installations, even laser-etched Eucharistic wafers (nonconsecrated, by the way).
Real-life exploits: She has exhibited at the MFA, the ICA, and several local colleges.
Origin story: "Besides Catwoman's cunning nature, excellent hand-to-hand combat skills, agility, and flexibility, I like the fact that she drove a Catillac. And despite her dominatrix exterior, at her core she's motivated by love."
&nbsp
Laurel Sparks/Batman
Medium: Painting. In a nod to the artists of the '60s and '70s, Sparks's work conveys some of the glam of those eras, thanks to the marble dust and glitter she adds to the acrylic.
Real-life exploits: This spring Sparks exhibited at ArtUnited in Vienna in a joint show with fellow Superhero Hannah Barrett (a.k.a. Robin).
Origin story: "Batman is a sexy millionaire playboy with a fast car and lots of fancy gadgets. He devotes his life to making the world a better place and, as a bonus, gets to snuggle up to Robin after a hard day's work."
&nbsp
Hannah Barrett/Robin
Medium: Oil painting. Barrett specializes in androgynous human figures that are at once funny and freaky as they gaze directly at the viewer.
Real-life exploits: Featured in a solo show this month at the Howard Yezerski Gallery, Barrett was tapped for the MFA's "Traveling Scholars" exhibit last year.
Origin story: "I chose Robin because he's the Boy Wonder, tight with Bruce Wayne, gets to hang out in the Batcave, ride around in the Batmobile, and keep Batman in line."
&nbsp
Rachel Perry Welty/Invisible Scarlet O'Neil
Medium: Drawing, sculpture, video, installation. Welty transforms throwaway items like styrofoam containers and sales receipts into elegant, thought-provoking abstracts, such as a shimmering wall made of 128,000 metallic twist ties.
Real-life exploits: Last year Welty's work entered the ICA's permanent collection, and she was selected as artist-in-residence at both the Santa Fe Art Institute and the Omi International Arts Center in New York state.
Origin story: "I chose her to expose the plight of female artists who are still underrepresented in gallery and museum shows as compared with men, and also to poke fun at the cult of celebrity and the artist-as-celebrity in our culture."
&nbsp
Ria Brodell/The Flash
Medium: Drawing, sculpture. Brodell's surreal drawings conjure up dreamlike creatures--birdmen, wormbunnies, sodmonsters--that dwell in what she calls "the distant lands."
Real-life exploits: She has exhibited at the MFA and the DeCordova Museum, as well as the Seattle Art Museum and the University of British Columbia.
Origin story: "I've always liked the Flash's simplicity. He doesn't have any gadgets or anything--he's just fast!"
&nbsp
Jeff Warmouth/Zorro
Medium: Installation, video, photography, sculpture. Last year he co-curated and directed Art Show Down, a seven-episode game show held at Cambridge's Art Interactive that mixed standup, physical competition, and an art exhibit.
Real-life exploits: His wry works involving humor and food have appeared at the DeCordova Museum, the Boston Center for the Arts, and international film festivals.
Origin story: "Zorro's a trickster with a sense of humor, and he fights against oppression. Plus, the costume showcases my handlebar mustache (which I didn't want to shave), I don't have to wear spandex, and I get to carry a sword!"
&nbsp
Andrew Mowbray/Green Lantern
Medium: Sculpture, installation, performance. Mowbray uses his artwork to explore the role of masculinity, past and present. (One recent piece featured the trappings of a day spent fishing at Walden Pond in homage to Henry David Thoreau.)
Real-life exploits: He has shown at universities and galleries throughout New England, including the Maine College of Art, and across the country.
Origin story: "Green Lantern was created in 1940 by struggling artist Martin Nodell, and I was interested in his use of multiple influences--Wagner's Ring, the story of Aladdin--to bring the character to life."

Brainy Babies
Boston is a growing hub for research into the infant mind.
By Hilary Levey Friedman
When Kristina Parry saw her five-month-old son, Jude, wearing a sensor net with wires protruding from his head at UMass Boston, her instinct was to rip it off. The cap looked to Parry like it might hurt the boy. But then he flashed her  his big dimpled smile, and I just laughed. 
Jude wasn't ill. Rather, a researcher at Brigham and Women's had contacted Parry the day after her son was born, and she had signed him up to participate in an early--childhood-development study investigating how long babies can remember details about a social interaction with their mothers.
Much of what we know about how children like Jude learn comes from infant-cognition experiments and much of that knowledge comes from Boston, home to the world's leading baby-brain research labs. Zsuzsa Kaldy, an associate professor of psychology at UMass Boston, estimates that the city has the greatest number of independent infant-research labs in the U.S.
The range of ways we study babies here is vast. Scientists at Children's Hospital use sensor caps, like the one Jude wore, to monitor the brain activity of infants who experienced a lack of oxygen at birth, trying to determine, among other things, how they recognize faces. Psychologists at Harvard, meanwhile, track eye movements to investigate the way babies learn to recognize specific people using cues such as skin color, clothes, and speech patterns. (A baby, it turns out, will stare longer at an adult who has a regional accent with which he's familiar. Clevah!)
This month Boston University will enter the ranks of local institutions with infant--research centers, joining the likes of Boston College, Harvard, MIT, and Northeastern. BU's program will be run by its Lab of Developmental -Cognitive Neuroscience, where researchers will focus on understanding the neural foundations of social engagement.
With so many labs, there is, understandably, a great demand for babies. In addition to soliciting recent and soon-to-be parents, labs recruit volunteers using public birth records, or just by asking for them on their websites. Children's Hospital's lab has close to 900 youngsters registered as test subjects, and Boston College's lab has tested 1,000 -infants over the past three years.
Given that many of their parents are involved in education and research, it's not shocking that Boston's babies are being called to contribute to science. After Rachel Beckhardt Hinchliffe gave birth to her son, Theo, for example, she read everything she could  to understand what he was thinking, feeling, and comprehending.  Now 18 months old, he's a veteran of four experiments at Harvard's Laboratory for Developmental Studies, and Rachel believes she's  helping future parents understand their babies. 
Sara Cordes, the principal investigator of the Infant and Child Cognition Lab at Boston College, contends that this attitude makes Boston a great place to study not just babies but also their parents. Cordes, who studies what role parents play in the development of mathematical abilities in their children by reading them counting books, explains that through this -research, we can discover how parents  give children a head start in the classroom before they even begin to speak. 
The Hype
The Good and Bad This Month
Woo!
The Red Sox kick off spring training on Februray 21, allowing Boston to begin forgetting the long nightmare that was last seas... sorry, we won't mention it again.
Stricter regulations on state pharmacies, designed to prevent incidences like last year's meningitis outbreak, go into effect this month.
We learn the name of the Franklin Park Zoo's new baby giraffe. The zoo spent months crowd-sourcing visitors for ideas, so we ssume the calf will end up with something like  Katniss. 
February vacation begins on the 19th. How hyped you are about this depends largely on whether you are a student or a parent.
We'll find out if Cantabrigians look for beauty on the inside, or if they'll just crown a looker in the Miss Cambridge Beauty Pageant.
After a tough breakup, Boston will pass this February 14 without its Valentine...ex-Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine, that is.
Season one of Southie Rules, a new reality show about a South Boston family fighting the invasion of the yuppies, airs on A&E. Enough with the Masshole stereotypes, already.
Yikes!

KG Unwrapped? Never.
Here's the thing about Kevin Garnett the man just loves his scarves. After nearly every game in the winter and sometimes even when it's warm KG emerges from the locker room with a muffler tied tightly around his neck. We asked Jeff Lahens, the founder of Dresscode Boston, to break down six of KG's go-to looks.
By Jason Schwartz
As time goes by: KG's style is  very classic,  Lahens says. Noting the martial design of his jacket, Lahens adds that the scarf's color  works well for the militry-preppy look he's going for. 
Blocking out:  He does a lot of double-sided scarves, double-colored,  Lahens says.  It creates a good contrast between one side to the next. 
Triple-double:  This one isn't bad,  Lahens says, but it's not his favorite.  There's so much going on there. 
You the man:  I like square patterns,  Lahens says.  I think it's masculine, and he's very masculine. 
Mr. Versatility: Lahens love the volors and patterns on this scarf.  It matches any type of color you would want to wear,  he says, adding that the classic design is  trend-proof. 
Split personality: According to Lahens, this one signals that in-game KG and post-game KG are two different people.  It's clean,  he explains. It's like KG is saying,  I can get my hands dirty, but I keep a clean white shirt. Or I can keep a clean white scarf.

Athletes Accessorized
It's not just Garnett. Among Boston's more-flamboyant sports stars, a handful have taken quirky items of apparel and worn them so memorably that well, we can't hear the words  man Uggs  without thinking the name...you know what we're thinking. Here, we highlight a few of the most memorable accessories worn by Boston athletes. (And no, dirty Patriots hoodies are not eligible.)
Tom Brady and those Uggs
We'd make fun of him, but even if we did, he'd still be Tom Effing Brady, and we'd still be us.
Big Papi's shades
Why wear sunglasses inside? To shade his eyes from all that bling he likes to wear, we preseume.
Rajon Rondo's hipster specs
Rondo's something of a math wiz. And he did intern at GQ last summer. Throw in his great court vision, and the nerdy-chic look makes sense.
Rob Gronkowski's bare torso
That's not actually an accessory, you say? You do understand we're talking abut Gronk, right?
Downtown Looking Up
The city's putting millins into Downtown Crossing on a simple bet: that small tweaks can make a big difference.
By Jason Schwartz
Folks walking around Downtown Crossing may have noticed some subtle changes lately: a new bench here, more trash cans there, and a growing sense that the area wasn't hit by the blitz. While big new developments have certainly driven the neighborhood's reemergence, the little things have gone a long way, too.  It actually makes the area feel safer, it makes the area feel cleaner, and it makes the area feel like it's a very busy downtown area,  says Randi Lathrop, of the city's Boston Redevelopment Authority.
To that end, the city has committed $3.2 million for infrastructure improvements to the neighborhood, with $1.1 million already spent. The Downtown Boston Business Improvement District (BID), an organization composed of area businesses, has spent another $450,000. Then there's the $8.6 million that Millennium Partners which is set to erect a new tower in the Filene's hole and which owns another nearby building has pledged to spend over the next few years on sidewalks, streetlights, traffic lights, landscaping, and a new MBTA station entrance, among other things. Here are some of the little things the city and the Downtown Boston BID are already putting big money into.
Completed city projects
1 Adding Big Belly trash cans :  $450,000
2 Pruning trees :  $11,000
3 Cleaning, upgrading, and replacing streetlights on Washington Street and in the Ladder District :  $40,000
4 Installing special  Boston  bike racks :  $1,500
Current city projects
5 Fixing and repairing sidewalks :  $1 million
6 Repaving streets :  $450,000
7 Redesigning the traffic island at Kingston and Bedford streets :  $450,000
8 Installing LED-illuminated street signs at about a dozen intersections :  $75,000
9 Creating guidelines for signage to help pedestrians navigate the area (a joint project with the BID) :  $50,000
Completed downtown Boston projects
10 Adding planters :  $201,000
11 Purchasing and putting up seasonal decorations :  $103,000
12 Creating a movable performance stage :  $62,000
13 Providing tables and chairs for outdoor seating :  $17,000
14 Installing rolling bollards to demarcate the pedestrian zone :  $13,500
15 Creating guidelines for signage to help pedestrians navigate the area (a joint project with the city) :  $50,000
The Tail End
Will shrimp and shrimp fishing soon disappear from our waters?
By Madison Kahn
Shrimp season in the Gulf of Maine has just started, but by the time you read this, it may already be over. That's because the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has reduced the catch limit by  72 percent this year, a dramatic move that means the current season may not last much longer than a week. This is not a happy prospect for the 2,000 New Englanders whose living depends on the industry.
The shrimp population in the region has been in precipitous decline in recent years, thanks to overfishing and global warming, and the commission had argued that only a complete ban on shrimping would allow the population a chance to rebound. But fishermen negotiated a compromise that will allow them to catch a total of 1.38 million pounds this year. Even so, that's a number that's unlikely to keep many of them employed for long. Two years ago, their total catch was almost 10 times greater.
Most people agree that overfishing has contributed significantly to the problem. But climate change is playing an ever-growing role. According to the environmental analyst Michael Armstrong, who has studied the situation for the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, a warmer ocean leads to smaller shrimp, and if ocean temperatures continue to rise at the current rate, the Gulf of Maine will one day be too warm for shrimp to reproduce at all.
The obvious solution would be for area shrimp to migrate north. But that isn't an option. A band of warmer waters borders the Gulf of Maine, creating a natural barrier that prevents shrimp from seeking new habitats off Canada's coast. So the local population is trapped, and its prospects don't look good.  It's very possible,  Armstrong says,  that the fishery could contract to just Maine before it's over and it may very well be over.

Junk in Bloom
A new installation depicts the creeping influence of garbage on our natural surroundings.
By Matthew Reed Baker
When you enter the Lower Tarlow Gallery, at Brockton's Fuller Craft Museum, you get the feeling you're in a formal garden. Some 40 plants, ranging from 4 to 9 feet high, rise from the corners of the room toward a central sculpture, a white clay globe. But soon you notice that there's something not quite right about the vegetation, and a closer examination reveals that it's made from clay, rebar, and scrap metal. A 675-square-foot installation called  Dark Garden,  it's a potent and vivid depiction of life and decay on a planet suffocating in its garbage.
The installation sprouted from the mind and kilns of the sculptor Linda Huey, who first came to Boston in 1969, and who bought the space where she lives and works, in Fort Point, in the early  '80s. Now she divides her time between the city and a house in western New York. Over the years, she has built a successful career making vases and bowls based on healthy plant forms, which she sells throughout the region. Her latest project, however, reflects the dread she feels about what's creeping into our natural surroundings.  With my pottery, my goal was to make flowers that were opening up and growing,  she says. But in  Dark Garden,  her flowers are different.  They're struggling more now,  she says,  or they're adapting to the influence of our culture. 
Huey started designing  Dark Garden  more than three years ago. It took that long to not only conceive of the plant forms but also to engineer them so that the metal, clay, and detritus wouldn't fall apart. Huey took as much inspiration from the roadside rubbish she picked up as she did from seedpods and dried flowers. The installation also comes with a measure of playful sarcasm, such as decaying fairy and gnome figures, and a bird's nest filled with junked toy cars.  I don't want to hit people in the face with the message,  Huey says.  I can't work out of anger, and I've had great fun making these pieces. It's maybe more a bit of fear I'm expressing. 
 Dark Garden  is on display February 2 to April 28 at the Fuller Craft Museum, 455 Oak St., Brockton, 508-588-6000, fullercraft.org.

INSIDER | WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW THIS MONTH
Logo Redo
By Lindsay Tucker
Starbucks, as you may have heard, recently updated its logo. Gone is any text, meaning the chain's famous siren now has the spotlight to herself. That got us thinking: What Boston-area logos have the potential to go typeless and stand on their own? 
Stop & Shop
"I don't know that Stop & Shop has reached full market saturation like Starbucks has, but they probably could drop their text. It has all the pieces of an iconic logo. It's reminiscent of fresh food and good quality."-James Adamé, Associate Design Director, Hill Holliday
Museum of Science
"For a local institution, this icon mark has no sense of place and is more a generic concept of science. The type is the only thing giving any connection to Boston."-Bryant Ross, Senior Designer, Continuum Innovation
Fidelity Investments
"The pyramid with the all-seeing eye is a foundation of money and power, so it's a good logo mark. It could live without the typography, but I wouldn't lose the text for the purpose of brand awareness."-James Adamé
Samsonite
"This icon doesn't feel unique. I love the simplicity, but it doesn't scream luggage. It's reminiscent of nautical imagery, flowers, and fans--nothing that would draw to mind the company the way the Starbucks identity does."-Aaron Belyea, Art Director, Alphabet Arm
Person of Interest: Charles Czeisler
Meet the Boston doc-no, not Rivers-responsible for keeping the Celtics perked up in the playoffs.
By Paul Flannery
For years, Charles Czeisler has complained about the NBA's morning practices, grumbled over late-night travel, and bristled at back-to-back road games. No, he's not some prima donna player. He's the Sleep Doctor, the NBA's foremost expert on shuteye, and he wants the league to do away with all those redeye flights and zzz-inhibiting practices.
"Why would the NBA want to do that to elite athletes?" Czeisler asks. "The goal is to see how well they play basketball, not to put them through the wringer and see if they can survive."  
Czeisler, chief of the division of sleep medicine at Brigham and Women's and director of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, began working with the NBA two seasons ago when he was asked to consult with the Portland Trail Blazers. These days he's the go-to guy across the sports spectrum, even though some teams end up ignoring his treatment plans-the Patriots disregarded his advice two years ago to avoid an overnight flight for a game in London. The Celtics, by contrast, are willing patients. In the summer of 2009, Czeisler met with coach Doc Rivers and showed him charts and brain-imaging studies illustrating how sleep deprivation affects reaction time, memory retention, and the immune system. 
The Celtics soon eliminated morning practices and instituted the "2 a.m. rule," which holds that if the players can't get to their hotel rooms in the next city by that time, then they stay where they are for an extra night and get their eight hours. Sound rest is all the more important for a veteran team like the Celtics, who have struggled playing games on consecutive nights. "Trying to create a window of 8 to 10 hours of sleep-it's almost impossible during an NBA season," Rivers says. "The way we were doing it made it completely impossible." 
Czeisler, who's helped everyone from astronauts to factory workers, considers proper rest nothing short of a "secret weapon." But it's his work with NBA players that has earned him the praise he really appreciates. "Dad," his teenage son recently told him, "I didn't realize you worked on something important." 
Who's Up, Who's Down
A look at the shifting fortunes of notable Bostonians.
WHO'S UP
Bill Simmons: The Sports Guy becomes the Sports Editor, launching a new website bankrolled by ESPN.
Steven Tyler: Yeah, we'll say it: We've really enjoyed him on American Idol. Dude talks like he's crazy.
WHO'S DOWN
Geoff Diehl: Hard to figure how someone can be both smart enough to get elected state rep and dumb enough to pass out fundraising material to third graders. Actually, no, it's not.
Monitor Group: The Cambridge consulting outfit did work polishing murderous dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi's image. We're sure this seemed like a great idea at the time.
Cap and Groan
It's college graduation time again! That means speeches. Boring, clichéd commencement speeches. Because we've been forced to endure these horrors too many times ourselves, we know there are certain conventions that will always be followed. But that doesn't mean we won't offer this year's crop of speakers the following formula for a less-awful graduation speech.  
25% Biographical anecdote twisted into passable nugget of wisdom
Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren, Brandeis, 2010 
> "People-young people, especially-seem fascinated with the fact that I served as a paratrooper. 'Cool,' they say. 'How many times did you jump?' And I disappoint them. 'I rarely jumped,' I say. 'Most times, there were these two large gentlemen on either side of the door who pushed me out.' Now you, too, stand at the door."
10% Quoting someone more profound than yourself, with implied (false) modesty
J. K. Rowling, Harvard, 2008
"I hope even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom. 'As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.'"
30% Inspirational exhortation, centered on the value of failure with requisite nod to humility
Smokey Robinson, Berklee, 2009
"Show business is a very fickle life. You're up today, you're down tomorrow. You're in today, you're out tomorrow. It's a life of peaks and valleys. Let your valley inspire you to get to the next peak. And if you have a lot [of] peaks in a row, don't take yourself so seriously that you think that you're it."
10% Dash of downer realism (a.k.a. something Mike Capuano would say)
U.S. Congressman Mike Capuano, Boston University, 2009 
"Nothing I say today or any other day can improve the job market. Nothing I say can really calm your anxieties. But it shouldn't. Life is anxiety from now on."
5% Blatant sop to school pride
GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Boston College, 2010
"[In] full disclosure, I will read exactly what I said in my commencement speech in South Bend three years ago: 'I believe in the values of Notre Dame.... Notre Dame is simply the best college in the world [pause], except for Boston College.'"  
20% Predictions of Greatness
Will Ferrell, Harvard, 2003 
"Some of you will be captains of industry and business. Others of you will go on to great careers in medicine, law, and public service. Four of you--and I'm not at liberty to say which four--will go on to magnificent careers in the porno industry. I'm not trying to be funny. That's just a statistical fact."
Whimsical Chairs
When archconservative David Koch cut the ribbon on MIT's new David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research (he donated $100 million to help build it), the irony was hard to avoid: A climate-change denier was funding some of the world's most cutting-edge science. That got us thinking about the other unexpected donations that have been made at local colleges:
The David H. Koch Head Coach of Men's Basketball at MIT 
>  Not only is Koch one of MIT's richest alums, he's also one of the best players in Beaver hoops history. In February he donated $2 million to endow the school's coaching position.
Myra and Robert Kraft and Jacob Hiatt Professor of Christian Studies at Brandeis
> Brandeis is the nation's foremost Jewish university. The Krafts are two of the Boston Jewish community's best-known leaders. Maybe they're covering all their bases? 
Lloyd C. Blankfein Professor of History at Harvard
> Today's multiple choice, class: Did Blankfein and his cronies at Goldman Sachs (a) ruin the U.S. economy, (b) plot to take over the world, or (c) both?
Boston's French Accent
By Jason Schwartz
Historian David McCullough is well known for his epic works on Bostonians who changed the world (see John Adams and 1776). His latest book, The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris, out May 24, offers more of the same, but with a twist. This time, McCullough follows a group of 19th-century Americans to France, and argues that what they learned there profoundly influenced America. The book, of course, is filled with locals who, upon returning home, went on to transform Boston. We talked with McCullough to build this handy guide to which hometown character did what. 
CHARLES SUMNER
In 1838, Sumner enrolled at the Sorbonne, where he studied alongside black pupils. McCullough says the experience caused Sumner to realize that the American racial hierarchy "was something we learned and not in the natural order of things." This epiphany led Sumner to the U.S. Senate, where he advocated for abolition. "Except for Lincoln," McCullough says, "no other voice in Washington was so powerful in the years leading to the Civil War and during it." 
AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS
Though not a native Bostonian, this master sculptor affected our city more than perhaps any other artist. Saint-Gaudens returned from Paris to play a large role in designing Trinity Church, but his biggest contribution was the relief for the Shaw Memorial, opposite the State House. "It is the first great American work of art to depict African Americans as heroes," McCullough says. "He considered that his most important piece of all, and it was."
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES SR.
Holmes revolutionized American medicine by teaching his students at Harvard Medical School what he'd learned about anatomy in Paris. Previously, McCullough says, American medicine was "very primitive." But in Paris, using cadavers to study anatomy was the norm. Thanks to his training there, Holmes saved countless Americans from surgery by doctors who otherwise would have had no idea what they were cutting into.
GEORGE HEALY
Here's a painter, McCullough notes, who "should be-and I hope will be-much better known than he is." According to the author, seven Healy pieces hang in the White House, and 17 are in the National Portrait Gallery. When the Boston-born artist-"an Irish kid off the streets"-set sail for Paris, he had virtually no money and barely spoke French, but there were no art schools or museums at the time in America for him to develop his talent. He returned a master.
Immodest Proposal : Frozen Assets
By Jason Schwartz
WHEN FREEZERS FULL OF expired food were recently discovered in Boston public schools, it led to justifiable howls of outrage. But, as usual, the whole thing has gone too far. Why, some demanded to know, were students being served this frozen dreck at all? Hasn't Michelle Obama been crusading for kids to eat fresh foods? Sure, rising obesity levels make it a bad idea to be sending children to Lunch-Lady Land for thawed sloppy joes, but studies have shown that frozen vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh ones. They're cheaper, too. So pump the kids full of 'em: peas coming out of their ears, broccoli out of their noses, and hopefully something going down their throats. And besides, if the school system can't manage to use frozen food efficiently, how can we expect them to put out fresh food before it turns rotten?

Shaking It Up-Again
By Matthew Reed Baker
DESPITE THEIR PLATINUM STATUS, the Cars haven't exactly left fans  pining for a reunion. Nerdy and aloof, Boston's New Wave heroes aren't beloved like Aerosmith or revered like the Pixies. And we already endured that best-forgotten New Cars project from a few years ago, which featured only the band's keyboardist and guitarist. 
So it's quite a surprise that Move Like This ($14, out 5/10), the group's first album with frontman Ric Ocasek in 24 years, turns out to be just what we needed. From the first song, "Blue Tip," all the elements are there: blippy synths, jerky rhythms, Ocasek's tuneful croak, and a huge riff that takes off in the chorus. After that it all sounds familiar-in a good way. The lead single, "Sad Song," has those trademark sassy handclaps. Massive group vocals and economical guitar solos abound. Granted, the Cars' main flaw-their awkward way with ballads-is still evident, but even those tracks ("Soon" and "Take Another Look") do grow on you. The only missing piece is bassist-vocalist Ben Orr, who died of cancer in 2000.
While this album may not surpass the band's classic records, it certainly holds its own. Listen to 1979's Candy-O and Move Like This back to back, and the current sound is bigger, brawnier...turbocharged, even. That many of the new songs are as good as the old is welcome proof that the Cars are excellent at what they do-which is race through 10 tight, punchy tracks in 37 utterly re-listenable minutes. So far, it's this year's most unexpected victory lap. 
The Must List May 2011
By Matthew Reed Baker
Event: SoWa Open Market
The city's top art and design market returns this month, setting up in the South End every Sunday through October. The bazaar showcases artists, jewelry designers, and even milliners-yes, the region's top hat people are here. And if you get hungry, hit the gourmet food trucks: Try Clover's popular chickpea fritters. Starts 5/1.
Words: David Sedaris
Whether recalling his tenure as a Macy's Christmas elf or creating fables about baboon hairdressers, there's nothing funnier than David Sedaris's essays-except for David Sedaris reading those essays in person. His "readings" usually skew more toward theatrical performance, and at Harvard's Sanders Theatre he'll be reciting new and unpublished works. $38â "$55, 5/7.
Dance: Balanchine/Robbins
For this season's grand finale at the Opera House, the Boston Ballet celebrates George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins, two of the greatest 20th-century choreographers. Balanchine's work is set to Mozart and Stravinsky, while Robbins-most famous for his work in West Side Story-gets the Debussy treatment. $25â "$132, 5/12â "5/22.
Kids: Boston Pops Family Concert
Sure, classical music is like broccoli for youngsters. But Keith Lockhart and pals are at least trying to dip it in chocolate sauce. This matinee at Symphony Hall features themes from Harry Potter and Star Wars, plus jazz, gospel, and a performance by the high school winner of the BSO's youth concerto competition. $21â "$91, 5/14.

What you need to know this month.
A Tale of Four Cities 
By: Paul Kix 
What do single people talk about when they talk to each other? And how do those conversations differ from location to location? The dating website OKCupid likes to ask these kinds of questions, especially with Valentine's Day here. So the company recently tracked the words that appear on the pages of subscribers in four metropolises, looking for the phrases that popped up again and again. Collectively, these personal interests wound up revealing as much about the cities as they did about the daters who live in them. All things considered, Bostonians emerged looking the best: smart, funny, and, well, dateable. 
BOSTON
Single Bostonians are the dating scene's intellectual overlords. When they're not talking about which grad school they attended, they're debating what sabermetric calculations prescribe for Carl Crawford's spot in the 2011 lineup. The best thing to do if you're single and dumb? Move.
Top phrases  |  Red Sox  (which appears nearly 20 times more often than typical phrases)  |  The Departed  |  Grad school  |  The ocean  |  The winter  |  ice cream
MIAMI
Single Miamians like the beach, and to "LOL," and, you know, the movies, and livin'. And the ocean. 
Top phrases  |  The beach  |  The ocean  |  Live life to the fullest  |  The movies  |  down to earth hip-hop  |  The gym    
NEW YORK
No offense to Hova or 30 Rock, but New Yorkers living in New York love talking about New Yorkers working in New York. Unless they're New York Yankees, because apparently no one there discusses that. Which is fine by us.
Top phrases  |  JAY-Z  |  30 ROCK  |  Arrested Development  |  True Blood   |  DINNER AND... 
LOS ANGELES
The only thing more disturbing than the vapidness and solipsism of L.A. singles is the fact that, to them,  commercial brands count as personality traits. "My iPhone" is the fourth most-discussed phrase among daters out there.
Top phrases  |  The beach  |  Sushi  |  The ocean [Ed. Note: Again, with the Ocean!]  |  My iPhone  |  The Big Lebowski  |  My career
Who's Up, Who's Down
A look at the shifting fortunes of notable Bostonians.
WHO'S UP
Dr. Daniel Haber
The MGH researcher and his team receive $30 million to help detect cancer cells in blood tests.
Mayor Menino
Hizzoner ensures the streets are cleared during the 2010 blizzard, something Mayor Bloomberg in New York does not do.
WHO'S DOWN
The South End's Dining Scene
First Ginger Park closes, now Rocca-and there are rumors of as many as four more places on the way out.
Jay Leno
His Tonight Show ratings are no better than the ones that got Conan O'Brien canned. Karma is a cowlicked redhead.
Insider Interview: Andre Dubus III
By: Matthew Reed Baker
The author finds his most conflicted subject yet: himself.
At first, writer Andre Dubus III had planned a 20-page personal essay about growing up in the heart of Red Sox Nation but somehow remaining ignorant about baseball. Since most boys learn the game from their dads, the piece soon led him to examine the distanced relationship he had with his famous father, the late short-story writer Andre Dubus. Ultimately the son expanded the work beyond an essay, encompassing his upbringing in the depressed 1970s Merrimack Valley and his years as a feared fistfighter in the streets and bars of Haverhill. A few years and 400 pages later, Dubus's searing account of his young life-Townie ($26, W. W. Norton)-is out, in stores February 28.
Fans of Dubus's novels such as House of Sand and Fog have admired how his complex characters muddle through moral binds, often with tragic consequences. Readers will find the same compelling drama here, in Dubus's own development as an angry young man, born out of such traumas as his father's affairs, his sister's rape, and his brother's suicidal urges. "Writing about my family was the most difficult part," he says. "But after that first draft, where I tried to write only about me...it felt like a bird with one wing. So I allowed in my family and home life, but I would only write about where their lives intersected with mine."
He is most candid while revealing his own life. When Dubus was an undersized teen, he watched his siblings get harassed by local thugs. The shame of his cowardice spurred him to build muscle and learn to box. Eventually the line between protecting his family and seeking out violence blurred. Like so many of his fictional characters, Dubus struggled for a graceful deliverance from bad decisions and tough times. He found it once he unclenched his fists and picked up a pen, channeling his anger onto the page.
"I haven't punched anyone in 23 years-writing changed everything," Dubus says. He's surprised at how cathartic Townie was, how he confronted and made peace with the stages of his life. "[But] I'd never written about that cowardly, terrified boy, because he was unattractive to me in my twenties and thirties. At this age, I feel frankly fatherly toward that boy."
THE LOCAL NINE
This month Senator Scott Brown releases his memoir, Against All Odds. Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, chronicles the best books by or about Hub politicians.
9. David Herbert Donald's Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War 
A Pulitzer-winning history of our great abolitionist senator, nearly beaten to death in Congress by a southern colleague. 
8. David McCullough's John Adams
Who knew a president from Quincy could be so compelling? And the wife....
7. Doris Kearns Goodwin's The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys
The city's Irish Ascendency, told through the lives-and eyes-of its royalty. 
6. Tip O'Neill's All Politics Is Local: And Other Rules of the Game
This is the pol's sharp-witted (though slightly disingenuous) defense of retail politics. 
5. William Bulger's While the Music Lasts: My Life in Politics
Though his career hasn't been as colorful (or homicidal) as brother Whitey's, Billy's book is still an excellent read.

When Crime Doesn't Pay
By Jason Schwartz
It's a local tradition: convicts lining up to publish their life story. So why muzzle the guy who faked his way into Harvard? 
Snooki wrote a book. So did the Situation. Kate, she of plus eight, has done three. Anyone who's sniffed fame, it seems, is liable to publish these days. That fact apparently weighed heavily on Middlesex Superior Court judge Diane Kottmyer in December, when she sentenced Adam Wheeler, the man who faked his way into Harvard. Kottmyer gave Wheeler 10 years of probation-and prohibited him from profiting from his story.
Fair enough. But why, then, has any mobster who's ever gotten within 5 feet of Whitey Bulger-Kevin Weeks, Eddie MacKenzie, et cetera-been allowed to cash in with his own tome detailing crimes much more heinous than duping the world's greatest university? 
Restricting a criminal from making money on his story seems like it could violate the First Amendment. And, in fact, the legal reasoning behind Wheeler's sentence is a bit messy. In a case related to the infamous Son of Sam murders, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1991 that a New York law barring criminals from profiting from their crimes was too broad and therefore unconstitutional. So Massachusetts repealed a similar law on its books. Four years later, though, the state's Supreme Judicial Court said judges may apply the condition in sentencing, because individual judges dealing with individual cases can be more precise than broadly applied laws are. "Once you're convicted, there are many types of restrictions that can be imposed on you during your term," says Jonathan Albano, a First Amendment specialist at Bingham McCutchen. 
In the end, it comes down to the judge and the prosecutor. The Middlesex DA typically asks that criminals in all high-profile cases be barred from profiting from their stories, says spokeswoman Cara O'Brien. In Suffolk County the policy is similar, though spokesman Jake Wark says such cases are rare. When the Suffolk DA did request that the prohibition be applied to Clark Rockefeller, the wannabe Brahmin who kidnapped his own daughter, the judge denied it. (Judge Kottmyer didn't respond to calls for comment about Adam Wheeler.)
As for why judges have let mobsters sell their stories, First Amendment lawyer Harvey Silverglate has a theory: "Maybe the judges make the assumption that they can't write to save themselves," he says. "It's probably a form of intellectual profiling. I'm not kidding. I don't think it occurs to judges that some of these guys might write books about their careers in crime. Whereas it's perfectly obvious that this Adam Wheeler character is a candidate to write a book."
Even if Wheeler were allowed to pump out a memoir, Albano figures the faker extraordinaire would have a bigger problem. "Nobody would believe it, anyway."

IMMODEST PROPOSAL | DOUBLE THE BUMS' PAY
By: Jason Schwartz
As his first act of 2011, Governor Deval Patrick cut the annual pay of Massachusetts legislators by $300, saying he wanted to keep their salaries in line with the state's median income. But here's the thing: We shouldn't be cutting salaries in the State House. We should be doubling them. A Massachusetts legislator's base pay is $61,440, or about a third of what a first-year associate makes at a good law firm. That won't attract top talent. Have you wondered why half of Beacon Hill studied at Suffolk Law and not at Harvard, BC, or BU? 
So we can keep complaining about the senator who stuffed bills down her bra, or the ex-speaker who (cough) allegedly took cash payments, or the lawmakers who packed the probation department with in-laws. Or we can admit that we've got bums because we're paying for bums. Raise the salaries and better candidates will follow. This isn't about rewarding lame politicians. It's about ensuring they get replaced by better ones.

THE ARTS BEAT
Everything Old...
A dour ancient Greek playwright whose work consists of grim tragedies with characters who don't talk to one another so much as deliver soliloquies-not exactly box-office gold. But watch: This production will be. On February 25, the American Repertory Theater will turn Aeschylus, that gloomy Greek, and his play Prometheus Bound-in which an immortal is chained to a rock, his liver eaten by an eagle-into a rock musical about political prisoners, with a score by Serj Tankian, leader of the million-selling punk-metal band System of a Down. The play is a follow-up to The Donkey Show, A.R.T.'s discofied take on A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Actually, repurposing classics is in vogue all across Boston. ArtsEmerson opened its season with Fraulein Maria, a reworking of The Sound of Music as a comedic ballet. The New Repertory Theatre will stage a rewrite of Ibsen's A Doll's House (opening February 27) that moves the action from 1870s Norway to modern Connecticut. In May the Huntington Theatre will host the British troupe Propeller, which scored big in the U.K. with its gory Victorian Gothic version of Richard III.
Of course, these aren't just intriguing artistic choices. They're good marketing decisions. If other houses hope to replicate A.R.T.'s buzz, they are also, in the process, addressing theater's generational shift. Established plays risk becoming period pieces, but drawing people to new stagings is a struggle. Promoting fresh takes on old ideas, then, is a safe hedge: When the patrons who revere tradition and those who seek out invention march through the same doors, there's a better chance they'll both rush the turnstiles for the rest of the season, even if there's no rock star on the marquee. â "M.R.B.

Length: 685 words
Byline: Interview by James Burnett

Top of Mind: Jim Gordon
Cape Wind president, Cape Cod vacationer, clean-energy pioneer, provocateur, 56, Boston
If you're looking to put up an offshore wind farm in Massachusetts, there are more politically expedient places than smack between the beloved beaches of the Cape and Islands. But there are not, Jim Gordon insists, any superior spots from an engineering standpoint. And so, for going on eight years, the Cape Wind founder has pressed on with his fight to construct 130 turbines there. In May, the project secured its final state permit; now all that's left is a "record of decision" from an enthusiastic-sounding Obama Interior Department. Could that come this month (to maximize the public relations tie-in to America's new push for energy independence)? Maybe. But if not, Gordon is prepared to wait as long as it takes.
You can't just say, "I want renewable energy, but I want it in someone else's backyard." It's an interesting thing: With oil, coal, and natural gas, you can truck, pipe, or barge it. With wind, you can't do that. You have to locate the facility where the wind is.
When the British embargoed salt during the Revolutionary War, the Cape and Islands responded, they had the salty sea and wind, and soon windmills dotted the landscape. In the 1800s, folks from New Bedford, Nantucket, and Cape Cod lit the lamps of industrial machinery by creating energy from whales. In World War II, our ports made ships to fight fascism. We have the marine and cultural heritage; we've responded to urgent challenges all throughout our history. Where better to do this?
Whether it's a football stadium or an art museum on Memorial Drive, if you look at any major infrastructure project in Massachusetts, it's not uncommon to have opposition. We have an active democracy.
I realize that our efforts are going to make it easier for the other companies that come behind us, but you know what? We need all the renewable energy we can get. That's a good thing.
My dad owned a couple of corner grocery stores in the Allston-Brighton area, and after school or on weekends I would go and work there. It was a great education. You learn how to deal with people.
I understand there are people who have a fear of the unknown. I understand there is a resistance to change. I understand that people may lash out if they're concerned about their property values.
The most overriding environmental threat to the Cape and Islands is climate change. We're talking about a low-lying community. We're already seeing the impacts: rising sea levels, more intense and frequent hurricanes and storms. There's a sad irony here that the "not in my backyard" crowd is fighting a project that is actually going to help mitigate some of those threats.
No matter how unfounded the criticism may be, I just don't take it personally.
I have great respect for [Cape Wind foe] Senator Kennedy. I had a meeting with him. It was very amicable. I'm only hoping the senator will recognize that Massachusetts wants a renewable-energy future.
We've invested a lot of our careers and significant years in this project. And a lot of money, many many many many many many many many many many many many many millions of dollars.
There's also a lot of waiting for things: responses and reports. It comes in fits and starts.
Patience has been a major requirement.
We've crawled and walked. We've evolved. But I think we literally are inches from the goal line.
Even those opponents who have invested a good deal in opposing this project, I think once it's up and running and they see that a lot of their concerns and fears haven't materialized, they will embrace it and be proud of it.
I've lived in the town that's closest to where the Cape Wind project is. My family still owns a home in South Yarmouth. When I visit the Cape now and I look out on the horizon, I imagine these small specks on the horizon. I can just see them gracefully spinning, quietly.
For me, the victory celebration will be walking on the beach that my dad used to take me to and looking out, and hoping that it's a clear day so I can see it in the first place.

Give your Thanksgiving celebration an eco-chic flavor with these sustainable staples. By Christie Matheson
A typical American Thanksgiving is an orgy of consumption--which is fun in the moment but rather harsh on the planet. Starting with the holiday and continuing through the end of the year, Americans throw out an extra million tons of garbage each week. Combine that with the inconvenient truth about climate change, and this season the coolest way to entertain is the eco-friendly way. Here's how: 
THE AMBIANCE: Skip the cut flowers (unless they're organic, they've been grown with lots of pesticides) and decorate instead with small pots of organic herbs; check out farm stands in your town or the Herb Farmacy in Salisbury. In lieu of paper place cards, collect fallen leaves and write guests' names on them with a paint pen. For lighting, take a cue from Krista Kranyak, owner of Jamaica Plain's Ten Tables restaurant, and use beeswax or soy candles instead of the petroleum-based kind.
THE TABLE: If you don't have enough tableware, pick up vintage plates, napkins, and serving pieces, which come with less packaging than new items--plus, the energy used to produce them was expended long ago. Lavender Home & Table has an excellent selection, and also carries napkins made from 100 percent linen rather than cotton (which when grown conventionally uses more pesticides than any other crop on the planet). Look for plates, bowls, and trays made from sustainable or recycled materials like bamboo and acacia wood, such as the Ekobo bowls at Lekker and the Scrapile repurposed-wood trays at Bliss Home.
THE FOOD: Cook with local ingredients. "The traditional Thanksgiving menu lends itself to eating this way," says Rob Pelletier of Choice Catering in Needham. Apples, cranberries, winter squashes, pumpkins, and free-range organic turkeys are all available from nearby farms. Verrill Farm in Concord and Barbara Lynch's new Plum Produce in the South End have extensive selections of fruits and veggies, and Boston-area Whole Foods stores stock all kinds of organic products, many locally sourced. (Even Wal-Mart now carries a host of organic produce, meats, and dairy.) Forgo the Butterball in favor of an organic bird from a local farm like Moon in the Pond in Sheffield, which raises heritage turkeys; the free-range American breeds have more flavor than mass-market birds. 
THE DRINK: Introduce guests to wines made from organically or biodynamically grown grapes, which are pesticide-free and grown naturally on biodiverse land. Vintages in West Concord and the Wine Bottega in the North End offer solid selections, but most shops carry at least a few bottles--just ask. California's Coturri Winery and the Rhone Valley's Chateau de Bastet produce good lineups of well-priced organic wines.
THE CLEANUP: Attack your mess with all-natural, biodegradable cleaning products such as the Caldrea line, available at Bliss Home, and wipe with reusable cloths or recycled paper towels. Recycle plastic containers, milk cartons, and wine bottles, and consider donating unused, unopened food to a local shelter. Store leftovers in environmentally friendly containers such as glass jars and cellulose bags, which biodegrade, unlike plastic wrap and aluminum foil.

The Recipe 
Maple Creme Brulee
A classic dessert gets an organic makeover.
SERVES SIX
3  c. organic heavy cream
1  c. organic Vermont maple syrup
6  local organic egg yolks
1  local organic egg
1  tsp. organic vanilla extract
1  tsp. sea salt
1/2  c. sugar
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. 2. In a medium saucepan, heat the cream and maple syrup over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until steam rises from the surface (do not let it boil). Remove from heat. 3. In a medium bowl, blend the yolks and egg. Stir the vanilla extract into the cream mixture, then slowly pour in eggs in three increments, stirring gently in between. 4. Place the pan in an ice water bath for about 10 minutes to cool the custard. 5. Divide custard among six 6-ounce ramekins. Place ramekins in a shallow water bath in an ovenproof baking dish and bake until the custard is firm, about 45 to 50 minutes. Remove ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Refrigerate for at least two hours and up to eight hours. 
To serve: 1. Preheat the broiler. Set ramekins on a baking sheet and top each with a dusting of sea salt, then a thicker layer of sugar (about 1/4 inch of sugar per ramekin, evenly distributed). 2. Place ramekins under the broiler for two to three minutes until the tops are hard and golden brown. Serve immediately if you like your creme brulee warm, or refrigerate for at least 10 minutes or up to two hours.

Hell Yeah, I Love My Car
The anti-car movement needs to get off its high bicycle and accept a simple fact-living in the city without a car sucks.  
Colin Kingsbury
SPRING IS RIGHT AROUND the corner, and we all know what that means: streets and sidewalks bustling with fair-weather bicyclists dodging cars and pedestrians, screaming "On the right!" and ringing their cute little bike bells like WE'RE the ones breaking the law. I particularly love when they keep their helmet on in the Whole Foods checkout lines, lest anyone fail to notice their inherent superiority for riding their amazing bicycle to the supermarket. And actually, they're merely the shock troops of the modern anti-car brigade: Zipcar-driving hipsters, bike-riding mayors, urban-planning professors, livability advocates, and even Ray LaHood-the secretary of transportation and a former Republican congressman-all convinced that cars are the worst epidemic cities have faced since cholera. 
Marc Schlossberg, a professor of planning, public policy, and management at the University of Oregon, neatly summarized the indictment in the New York Times: "The costs of using the car for every type of trip...are finally apparent, from their contribution to global climate change, the national obesity epidemic from loss of daily physical activity and the 40,000 deaths per year on the road-ways, to the social isolation and neighborhood fragmentation that the roadway system creates." 
And here I was thinking that cars were just a mode of transportation that has done as much to modernize the world as clean water. Instead, cars are responsible for obesity, death, and terrible neighborhoods, plus the fact that we're destined to a lifetime of loneliness. But you want to know something? 
I don't care. This past January-after three years of going without wheels-I was downright giddy to go to a dealer and buy myself a car. Because here's the secret the anti-auto mafia doesn't want you to know: The only thing better than living without a car in Boston-America's third-most-walkable city-is living here with one.
When I officially went car-free a few years ago, it was for the same reason I have always been yacht-free and chalet-in-Gstaad-free: I didn't have the money. I'd been driving a banged-up '98 Ford Escort since 2004, when I started my software company, but by May 2009, every part of the business had grown except my own salary. So when I came up against a $1,000 estimate for repairs to pass inspection, I sold the junker to a guy with a flatbed truck and $105.
Car-free-and-loving-it types often describe dumping their automobile as a moment of liberation. I have to admit, for a while I kind of saw their point: There was no more waking up in terror that I'd parked on the wrong side of the street and was about to get towed. And when winter came, I'd look at my neighbors excavating their buried hoopties from a snowbank and think, "Suckers!"
Largely because my daily commute from East Boston consisted of a mere walk to the T, and because my bachelor lifestyle revolved mostly around an assortment of downtown watering holes, it took a while before things began to go to pieces. The train went pretty much everywhere I needed to go in order to survive, and I could grab the makings for dinner at my neighborhood market. And if a cute redhead with a smorgasbord of progressive buttons on her messenger bag happened to compliment me on my environmental awareness, well, it didn't matter why my carbon emissions had plummeted, did it? 
But slowly, my world shrunk. What had been a 20-minute drive to visit friends on the far side of the Charles or across Mass. Ave. was now an hour-plus schlep requiring at least two train lines and a bus. Which meant I wound up seeing a lot less of them. And those romantic, oh-so-European daily trips to the neighborhood market for fresh produce quickly became a price-gouging hassle. Leaving the city wasn't worth the trouble of booking a rental car or hitching a ride with generous friends, so everything outside the 617 area code suddenly resembled the fringes of a centuries-old map inscribed "Uncharted Territories."
As for those supposed car-ownership replacements? Ha! Zipcar is great for a trio of Fenway-dwelling Berklee students making the occasional Ikea run, but costs become prohibitive for regular users, and the need to return cars to central parking spots can make it more of an ordeal than taking the bus. Meanwhile, with four seasons that feature everything from blizzards and high winds to torrential rain and thunderstorms, bicycles are more a means of recreation than transportation for anyone who has to wear actual pants, let alone a suit, to work.
Here's the truth: Going car-free is considerably easier if you are happy spending a relative fortune to rent a small apartment in an ultra-high- density neighborhood; enjoy one of a limited number of well-paying jobs in a downtown office; rarely need to move anything larger than a week's supply of Lean Cuisine frozen dinners; and are happy within the confines of your neighborhood. Just imagine commuting from Dorchester to an office park on Route 128, or wrangling two children and a week's worth of groceries onto a bus, which many less-well-off Bostonians do. Only a few neighborhoods-mostly Beacon Hill and the Back Bay-have the density to support the kind of mass-transit network and local retail presence to make car ownership largely irrelevant the way it is in Manhattan. No, in Boston, a voluntary carless lifestyle is only realistic for the young and childless with the luck of working at a well-paying job near a T stop. In short: yuppies. They're the very same people who subscribe to locavorism and sneer that food in this country is far too cheap, but have no clue what it's like to raise a family in a dodgy neighborhood or take the bus to a low-paying job across the city.
Needless to say, I was more than thrilled when my business finally took off last year and I was able to go out and buy some wheels. And no, I didn't opt for a gas-guzzling eight-cylinder Ford F-150 with a gun rack and a collection of anti-Obama bumper stickers. I bought a sporty little Miata, for two simple reasons: It's easy to wedge into small parking spaces and corners harder than a Green Line trolley. It's the perfect city car. 
The day I picked it up, I zipped over to Union Square for dinner with an old friend. It took 15 minutes, not an hour. Our conversation naturally focused on the new places I could now visit, all the quirky small retailers scattered around the fringes of the city (specialty barware!), and the jaunts up and down the coast. No longer hitched to the vagaries of the T or the availability of Zipcars, I knew the world was once again my bivalve. 
It wasn't cars that devastated cities, but urban planners with a terminal excess of confidence in their own genius. The midcentury notion that the world ought to be segregated into vast tracts of exclusively residential, commercial, or industrial zones linked by multilane highways is now rightly regarded as a radical and myopic shift from how cities previously grew-slowly and organically, boasting a combination of homes and businesses. Livable cities are, above all else, places where people can pursue the sort of life they want, and for the vast majority of people, that includes a car.
The morning after my trip to Union Square, I was just as delighted to once again get to work by walking out my front door and down the street to the T stop. Public transit is a boon of city living, and frankly, trying to commute in this city is madness. But now that I'm also armed with car keys, I can, and will, go far beyond the limits of my neighborhood.
Now, please excuse me. I think I hear a street sweeper coming....

No More Pencils, No More Books, No More Teachers' Dirty Looks
Almost forty Massachusetts teachers have lost their licenses in the last eight years, most for sexual misconduct. Fifty more are under investigation. Even more scary--the state has no way of knowing if a teacher molested children someplace else. Why not? A dangerous loophole in the law.
By Doug Most
His e-mails read like the sappy drivel of a lovesick newlywed separated from his bride for the first time. "Happy five months my love," says one. "They have been the best five months of my entire life." Six days later: "I wanted to tell you about this dream I had last night. It was that we made love in the woods (again). . . . I dreamt that you took me to a level of romance that I had never experienced before." Just hours before: "Angel, I do not have time to respond properly to your email. . . . You can bet I will! I ove [sic] you so much. All day today on the course I just smiled. . . . I love you."
Of course, if these were simply the words of a blissful husband cooing to his young wife via the magic of the Internet, anybody who stumbled across them would, most likely, have ignored them. But these e-mail messages were written by a teacher at Palmer High School, Kim-Michael Mertes, to a 14-year-old girl at another Massachusetts high school. And Mertes's principal, John P. Williams, could hardly ignore that.
"I am writing to inform you," Williams wrote in a certified letter to the popular science teacher and field hockey coach, "that you have been placed on paid administrative leave effective immediately."
Mertes resigned, and, while he was never criminally charged--and denies he had sex with the girl, despite explicit references in his e-mails--the state did something most people never hear about: It took away his teaching license. Mertes, who was living in Northampton, left town, landing a job coaching field hockey and lacrosse at Virginia Wesleyan College.
That was three years ago, a seemingly isolated case of one teacher befriending a student, and then, as his own resignation letter admitted, developing "a relationship built on sympathy and concern for her, which obviously crossed the line."
But three years ago, that line was in a different place. There had not yet been a scandal in the Catholic Church to give parents pause, to make them wonder about the backgrounds, personalities, even the sexual preferences, of every authority figure, no matter how trustworthy, in their children's lives. After all, many of the accused priests spent only an hour or two per week with their victims, if that. Teachers and coaches cross paths daily, over and over again, with their students--in class, in the hallways, in locker rooms, after school, even from the privacy of their homes, thanks to e-mail.
Mertes's e-mails are among hundreds of pages of records of Massachusetts teachers, obtained by Boston magazine after a lengthy legal battle with the state Department of Education. They show that defrocked priests have plenty of company when it comes to preying on children. The state has revoked, suspended, denied, or limited the licenses of at least 38 teachers in the last eight years, these records show, almost all of them for sexual misconduct.
There was Zack Burwell, a Boston teacher who pleaded guilty to rape and indecent assault and battery on a person over 14.
There was James A. Ballard, hired as assistant superintendent in West Springfield, who was fired and had his license revoked after officials learned he had lied on his job application by not mentioning that he'd been convicted in North Carolina of making sexually harassing phone calls.
There was James Risi, who state records show had an inappropriately close relationship with a girl in his fourth-grade class in Dover, often whispering "I love you" to her.
And there was Robert E. Miller, who pleaded guilty to accosting students in his Springfield class, inviting one to sit on his lap.
That's only a sampling of the closed cases. (More appear on page 208.) There are another 52 cases pending, from Brookline to Natick to Haverhill, most of them involving sexual allegations. And those are just the incidents that have been discovered. Experts say that for every victim who comes forward there are nine who keep their troubles to themselves. That's potentially hundreds of victims in this state. Nor are private-school teachers licensed, meaning there is no requirement for those schools to report sexual misconduct cases to anyone.
None of this can be very comforting to educators and lawmakers in a state like Massachusetts. Though the Education Department has toughened some regulations to crack down on abusive teachers in the last few years, it has failed to correct other flaws, leaving schools at risk of hiring someone who may simply be doing what Kim-Michael Mertes was doing when he landed in Virginia: running from a dark past.
As loopholes go, this one is big enough to drive a school bus through. Just ask Phillip Littlefield, the Methuen superintendent. School was winding down last spring when two high school girls came forward alleging that Dennis Sheehan, a special education teacher, had groped them and forced them to kiss him. Within weeks, Sheehan had been fired and arrested on charges of battery and indecent assault. That alone was enough to ruin any superintendent's day--having one of his teachers busted. (The case is pending.) But the news got worse for Littlefield.
Turns out that Methuen had hired Sheehan after the Londonderry, New Hampshire, school district, 16 miles to the north, had fired him three years earlier because of a similar scandal: his arrest when a pair of high school girls said he masturbated in the classroom while they were taking a makeup test after school. Sheehan, who was acquitted in court, simply drove south and crossed into Massachusetts, where he found a substitute-teaching job in Arlington. Methuen hired him in January.
Had anyone simply typed "Dennis Sheehan" and "Londonderry" into a search engine like Google, an official link to the New Hampshire Public Employee Labor Relations Board would have popped up, with details about the teacher's past. Of course, as even students are taught, the Internet is hardly the most reliable source, making other checks essential.
And that's where Massachusetts falls short of what other states have done. Before a teacher, or any school employee, for that matter, is hired here, the hiring district has the state's Criminal History Systems Board do a background check. That check will flag most arrests in this state--but nowhere else. Only the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division, which is used by 42 states to vet new teachers, searches fingerprint records on file everywhere. People who buy guns in Massachusetts have their criminal records checked nationwide, thanks to new gun control laws. But a person applying for a teaching job here could conceivably have rape convictions in the 49 other states and still land the job because his criminal record in Massachusetts would be clean.
"It's a cursory background check," admits Frank Shea, the state Department of Education's investigator of educator misconduct.
It's a particularly troubling gap in Massachusetts, which borders New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, and New York, and is a snowball's throw from Maine, making it a convenient destination for any teacher on the run hoping to stay close to home. Like Sheehan.
"I think people like this become creative in circumventing whatever we put in place," Littlefield says. "A person can just go across the border, and if they do have a record, but not in Massachusetts, it won't show up. That is a big loophole. We need to build a better mousetrap. I don't ever want to be in a position like this again."
Littlefield says that he and other public officials plan to push state and federal lawmakers to establish one database all schools can tap into, showing records from every state. It will cost the districts money--something they have very little of these days--but if it's, say, $ 50 per search (in New Hampshire, the searches cost $ 34 per teacher), Littlefield says he'd find a way. "I think each student here is worth $ 50," he says. "Don't you?"
State Senator Cheryl Jacques, who is spearheading the effort to change state laws in the wake of the clergy abuse scandal, calls the loophole in the background checks "a tragedy waiting to happen." But closing it, she adds, won't be cheap. "It's easy to say, Let's do it, but a whole other thing to fund it," she says. "I imagine our school districts would say, 'Put this in our school aid.' And, as you know, school aid's being cut. I don't want to pass an unfunded mandate."
Until something changes, Shea says school districts have to ask the tough questions before hiring someone, especially since he estimates that 25 percent of prospective teachers lie on their applications and that reference checks are often useless because many people are hesitant to say something bad about their former employees and coworkers. There are warning signs, however, that should at least make a principal or superintendent wary. If a teacher is applying for a job after a long stint somewhere else, why is he suddenly leaving? If she's changing jobs and changing fields, from history to special education, for example, why the shift? If he's leaving another state entirely, what's driving him out?
With the reverberations still strong from the church crisis, people who track this problem say it's an ideal time to push for better protection of schoolchildren. A survey by the trade publication Education Week found that other states are moving aggressively to criminalize sex between educators and older teenagers, to strengthen background checks of school employees, and to stop child molesters from moving to new jobs. "It's a very receptive climate," says Shea.
Toughening the background checks would be the simplest, most clear-cut improvement. But there's another weakness in Massachusetts law that other states have already addressed, one that raises moral issues schools are often nervous about confronting: This is one of 23 states without a law making sex illegal between a student and educator. Sex is legal in Massachusetts between a student and school employee as long as the student is at least 16. While 27 states ban teacher-student sex, Massachusetts doesn't, which critics say is inviting trouble. "Consent has no place in a relationship with a student and a teacher," says Terri Miller, president of a national network called SESAME, for Stop Educator Sexual Abuse, Misconduct & Exploitation. "When it's an authority figure, that student can't give consent. There is grooming and manipulation and seduction, until that teacher gains physical access to that student. They can call it consensual because they have groomed them to consent. But it's exploitation."
Of course, it's never that simple. Even hugging has become an issue in the climate of sexual harassment. "Hugging a six-year-old girl is one thing," says Shea, the investigator, "but hugging a 16-year-old is another. It depends on the type of hug."
Many times, the allegations teachers face fall into that gray area. Shea recalls one incident in which a teacher spotted a female student walking away with a five-dollar bill hanging out of the back pocket of her jeans. The teacher called her back and stuffed his hand in her pocket, pushing the money down. Shea pauses and shrugs his shoulders. "Duh," he says. The girl went home, told her mother, and a complaint was filed. The teacher could have simply told the girl to tuck the money away herself. But does that mean his intention was sexual or was it merely playful? Crossing that line can mean the difference between a long and honorable teaching career or a disgraceful departure--as James Doherty discovered.
Doherty was a staff member and coach of almost every sport for 40 years at Savio Preparatory High School in East Boston, an independent prep school run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. A member of the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame, he was respected by his players, who told police he would often massage his runners' legs without ever making them uncomfortable. But then two years ago, three girls came forward, indecent assault and battery charges were filed, and Doherty admitted his massages had crossed that boundary, that he had touched the students' genitals. He pleaded guilty.
Other cases leave no doubts. John Shockro, a teacher in Mattapoisett, pleaded guilty in 1997 to raping two teenage girls. Paul Alves was a New Bedford elementary school teacher when police raided his home in 1994 and found stacks of child pornography. He pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography and lost his license. In 1995, state records show, Glen Mohika, a Lawrence High School administrator, was charged with molesting two boys and denied a license. He was subsequently convicted of indecent assault and battery.
No laws could have prevented those incidents, but Shea says there is one change that could immediately help the Department of Education when it first learns of an abuse allegation: the power to wield investigative subpoenas, which can compel witnesses to testify and reluctant school districts to produce vital information. "The Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine has it, and the Board of Bar Overseers has it," Shea says of investigative subpoena power. "Protecting children is similar in urgency to protecting clients and patients."
Two years ago Shea saw the power of changing the rules, when the Education Department imposed a new regulation requiring school administrators to start reporting to the state whenever any educator was dismissed for a specific incident. Until then, a teacher could be fired, but the school district didn't have to make the reason public, meaning that the teacher could move on to a new job more easily. Shea was typically juggling 10 to 15 cases at a time when that regulation changed. Now he has more than 50, most of them involving sexual allegations, the rest thefts and drunken driving arrests. "We knew stuff was going on, but we just couldn't get at it," Shea says. "It's just like the church: In the last year I've seen a huge increase in reporting."
Of course, while some of these cases were the subject of coffee shop gossip in their communities, and a few were reported in the local media, many have slipped by quietly, and the state does not disclose the details when it revokes a teacher's license. The Department of Education refused for three months to release the files at all to Boston magazine, until the magazine appealed to the state supervisor of public records, who called the delay "unreasonable" and the refusal "unacceptable," and ordered that the records be produced.
No formal studies of child molesters in schools have been done, though one report found that in 1998 there were 103,600 reported cases of sexual abuse in public schools nationwide, most involving teachers. In most cases of sexual exploitation of children, men are usually the predators, and the victims are almost always boys. Rather than force themselves on children with violence, the men lure them with enticements--usually pornography, alcohol, or marijuana.
As the case of Kim-Michael Mertes shows, the Internet has also spawned a new way for teachers to reach out to children, a method perceived as being discreet, but that has become less so as police find ways to infiltrate chat rooms and pose as curious kids.
Just last spring, Shea revoked the license of Francis Lambert, a Hudson physical education teacher who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography. Lambert's 30-year teaching career ended abruptly when school officials found he had tried to access 1,000 porn sites from his school computer, downloaded kiddie porn at home, and sent inappropriate e-mails to a 12-year-old girl.
Haverhill police arrested a high school teacher over the summer who allegedly admitted he was addicted to sex and the Internet, and who they say chatted online with someone he thought was a 13-year-old girl about meeting for sex; in fact, he was chatting with an undercover cop. A similar scenario led to the arrest of Joseph Doyle, a Natick High School hockey coach who resigned after his arrest last spring in New Hampshire. Police say he was expecting to meet a 14-year-old boy he had contacted on the Internet--a boy who turned out to be an undercover detective. The case is pending. Doyle had been forced to resign in 1988 from St. Sebastian's School in Needham for throwing a party with alcohol for underage students.
When cases like these break, they leave behind tornado-like wreckage, from the confused students, to the angry parents, to the embarrassed administrators. All of those emotions are washing over Brookline High School this fall as the staff and student body reel from the shock of not one, but two arrests. Geoffrey Dana Hicks, a 48-year-old music teacher from Newton, has pleaded not guilty to raping a child under 16, and just a few weeks before his arraignment, Waldemar Ulich, a 61-year-old former teacher of English as a second language, was arrested on 10 counts of indecent assault and battery on a child over 14. His case is pending. Hicks was suspended. Ulich, who caught the attention of Brookline officials five years back when a student accused him of assault--the charge was dropped--has resigned.
Those cases are public because they occurred at a public school. Private schools monitor themselves, so unless a case reaches the courts it is likely to never become public.
That's what happened when Phillips Andover Academy English teacher David Cobb was fired after 27 years and convicted in 1996 of attempted sexual assault after he posed as a camp counselor to lure a 12-year-old boy and showed pornographic pictures to a 13-year-old boy. Because Cobb was convicted in Massachusetts, it would show up if he ever arrived on some unsuspecting principal's doorstep in this state. But had it happened 20 minutes to the north, in New Hampshire, Cobb might have found a job here easy to come by--as Littlefield learned.
"As a person entrusted with the safety and well-being of children," he says, "I want to know more."
