At least 85% of the global population has experienced weather events made worse by climate change, according to new research published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. Using machine learning to analyze and map more than 100,000 studies of events that could be linked to global warming, researchers paired the analysis with a well-established data set of temperature and precipitation shifts caused by fossil fuel use and other sources of carbon emissions. These combined findings — which focused on events such as crop failures, floods and heat waves — allowed scientists to make a solid link between rising temperatures and human activities. They concluded that global warming had already affected 80% of the world's land area. 
"We have a huge evidence base now that documents how climate change is affecting our societies and our ecosystems," said lead author Max Callaghan, researcher at the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Germany. The study provides hard numbers to back up the lived experiences of people from New York City to South Sudan. "Climate change," Callaghan said, "is visible and noticeable almost everywhere in the world." The findings come amid a major push to get countries to commit to more ambitious climate goals ahead of a United Nations summit in Glasgow next month. Research shows that existing pledges will put the planet on track to heat up about 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a level of warming that would lead to drastic food and water shortages, deadly weather disasters and catastrophic ecosystem collapse. Some of the world's top emitters, including China and India, have yet to formally commit to a new 2030 emissions reduction target. Activists worry that an emerging energy crisis, which has raised prices and triggered blackouts, could imperil efforts to get developing economies to phase out polluting fuels. In United States, climate disasters have already caused at least 388 deaths and more than $100 billion in damage this year, according to analyses from The Washington Post and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Yet despite a pledge to halve emissions by the end of the decade, congressional Democrats are struggling to pass a pair of bills that would provide hundreds of billions of dollars for renewable energy, electric vehicles and programs that would help communities adapt to a changing climate. The contrast between the scope of climate disasters and the scale of global ambition is top of mind for hundreds of protesters who have descended on Washington this week to demand an end to fossil fuel use. The activists, many of them from Indigenous communities that have been harmed by global warming, risked arrest as they remained on the sidewalk outside the White House after police ordered them to clear the area. The new research in Nature adds to a growing body of evidence that climate change is already disrupting human life on a global scale. Scientists are increasingly able to attribute events like heat waves and hurricanes to human actions. In August, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change devoted an entire chapter to extreme weather consequences of a warming world. The study's conclusion that 85% of humanity is experiencing climate impacts may sound high. But it's "probably an underestimation," said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College, who was not involved in the study. The study looked at average temperature and precipitation changes, rather than the most extreme impacts, for which Otto says there is an even more evidence of climate change's role. "It is likely that nearly everyone in the world now experiences changes in extreme weather as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions," she said. The human toll of these events has become impossible to ignore. This summer, hundreds of people in the Pacific Northwest died after unprecedented heat baked the usually temperate region. More than a million people in Madagascar are at risk of starvation as a historic drought morphs into the a climate-induced famine. Catastrophic flooding caused New Yorkers to drown in their own homes, while flash flooding inundates refugee camps in South Sudan. In a letter released Monday, some 450 organizations representing 45 million health-care workers called attention to the way rising temperatures have increased the risk of many health issues, including breathing problems, mental illness and insect-borne diseases. One of the papers analyzed for the new study, for example, found that deaths from heart disease had risen in areas experiencing hotter conditions. "The climate crisis is the single biggest health threat facing humanity," the letter said. Yet in many of the places that stand to suffer most from climate change, Callaghan and his colleagues found a deficit of research on what temperature and precipitation could mean for people's daily lives. The researchers identified fewer than 10,000 studies looking at climate change's effect on Africa, and about half that number focused on South America. By contrast, roughly 30,000 published papers examined climate impacts in North America. In poorer countries, the researchers say, roughly a quarter of people live in areas where there have been few impact studies, despite strong evidence that they are experiencing shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns. In wealthier countries, that figure stands at only 3%. "But it indicates that we're not studying enough," Callaghan said, "not that there isn't anything happening."

If you're like us, when the tornado warnings go out across southern Illinois, do you wonder: Is this one more symptom of climate change? That's impossible to answer with any precision. We have had tornadoes and stormy weeks before. 
It's hard to pinpoint what drives a single weather event. But what is clear is that extreme weather — the record heat waves, wildfires and unprecedented flooding that have ravaged the globe this summer — is a hallmark of this undeniable change. Climate change is not some distant threat; it is here. And the impact of it is only going to get worse. It's going to get worse even if we do something about it. All we're left with now is to minimize how much worse it gets. If we do nothing or next to nothing, if we continue to kid ourselves that it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of the planet's weather, well, then it will become a catastrophe. If we all have not been alarmed by the extreme weather so far in 2021, we should be by the report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It warns that world leaders must act immediately to reduce human reliance on fossil fuels or risk significant growth of extreme weather events. But this is not just a matter for world leaders and politicians. It is an existential challenge that calls on all of us to do our parts. Some responses will be easy. Some will be hard. All must be done. We must reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we must make wise choices in how we adapt to the climate change that already has been set in motion. The U.N. panel said scientists are observing irrefutable climate changes in every region of the planet. "Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion, such as continued sea level rise, are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years," they said. Left unchecked, these changes will affect virtually everything about human life as well as the lives of other animals who share the planet with us: our water and food supplies, sea levels, where and how we live, our health, our economies, virtually everything. "We just barely have the time," says Illinois congressman Sean Casten. "Our moment is right now to do what's necessary." We can pretend no longer.

Physics Nobel rewards work on climate change

STOCKHOLM — Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for work that found order in seeming disorder, helping to explain and predict complex forces of nature, including expanding our understanding of climate change. Syukuro Manabe, originally from Japan, and Klaus Hasselmann of Germany were cited for their work in developing forecast models of Earth's climate and "reliably predicting global warming." The second half of the prize went to Giorgio Parisi of Italy for explaining disorder in physical systems, ranging from those as small as the insides of atoms to the planet-sized. 
Hasselmann told The Associated Press that he "would rather have no global warming and no Nobel Prize.'' Manabe said that figuring out the physics behind climate change was "1,000 times" easier than getting the world to do something about it. He said the intricacies of policy and society are far harder to fathom than the complexities of carbon dioxide interacting with the atmosphere, which then changes conditions in the ocean and on the land, which then alters the air again in a constant cycle. He called climate change "a major crisis." The prize comes less than four weeks before the start of high-level climate negotiations in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders will be asked to ramp up their commitments to curb global warming. The Nobel-winning scientists used their moment in the limelight to urge action. "It's very urgent that we take very strong decisions and move at a very strong pace" in tackling global warming, Parisi said. He made the appeal even though his share of the prize was for work in a different area of physics. All three scientists work on what are known as "complex systems," of which climate is just one example. But the prize went to two fields of study that are opposite in many ways, though they share the goal of making sense of what seems random and chaotic so that it can be predicted. Parisi's research largely centers around subatomic particles, predicting how they move in seemingly chaotic ways and why, and is somewhat esoteric, while the work by Manabe and Hasselmann is about large-scale global forces that shape our daily lives. The judges said Manabe, 90, and Hasselmann, 89, "laid the foundation of our knowledge of the Earth's climate and how human actions influence it." Starting in the 1960s, Manabe, now based at Princeton University, created the first climate models that forecast what would happen as carbon dioxide built up. Manabe is such a pioneer that other climate scientists called his 1967 paper with the late Richard Wetherald "the most influential climate paper ever," said NASA chief climate modeler Gavin Schmidt.

Climate change endangers bird habitats, then birds

We found a highly unlikely bird last month during the Christmas Bird Count at Cantigny — a Nashville warbler. The species migrates through our region in the spring and early fall, and during those times it's pretty easy to spot one. But after October? Good luck with that.
So what was a Nashville warbler doing here on Dec. 19? And what about the painted bunting that caused a media sensation in New York City, also in December?
The knee-jerk response to these questions might be two words: climate change. Or an even better guess: El Nino. But cases of misplaced birds are nothing new. Storms and strong winds are often to blame, or sometimes a bird's internal compass just goes haywire. Birds get lost.
That said, warmer conditions may cause a wayward bird to stay put in the same place for days or weeks, assuming it locates a food source. It learns to adjust.
Indeed, the ability of birds to adapt to new environmental conditions is one of their key strengths. That's the good news. The bad news is that global warming in the decades ahead will test their resourcefulness like never before.
In November I went to hear a talk about the effects of climate change on birds in the Chicago region. The speaker was Doug Stotz, a conservation ecologist and ornithologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. He's also the co-chairman of the Chicago Wilderness Climate Change Task Force.
"The great thing about climate change is that it makes our winters warmer," Stotz said. "It's hard, as a Chicagoan, not to think that's a good idea."
Yes, I think we could all agree that ditching the down-filled parkas and flannel-lined jeans would be OK. And what birder around here would not enjoy some traditionally southern or southwest species moving into our region as average temperatures climb?
We know it's wrong, but it's hard to stop visions of painted buntings and scissor-tailed flycatchers from dancing in our heads. A few southern beauties are already here.
"Blue grosbeak, summer tanager and yellow-throated warbler are birds that didn't use to breed in the Chicago area, but they do now," Stotz said.
But whatever advantages climate change may hold for shivering Chicagoans and thrill-seeking birders, Stotz made one thing perfectly clear: Global warming is not good for most birds. The science tells us so.
In 2014, the National Audubon Society unveiled a seven-year study on the predicted impact of climate change on North American bird populations.
Out of 588 species studied, 314 were deemed at risk from global warming by 2080. For many, according to Audubon's climate model, the "gathering storm" will come sooner. To survive, the birds must adapt to losing huge portions of their current living areas.
Stotz cited the bobolink, a grassland species that even now struggles to prosper in the Chicago region. Climate change is shifting the bird's range northward. By 2050, he said, "Bobolinks are going to be in what is now boreal forest. It seems unlikely that will work."
Of the 314 at-risk species identified by Audubon, 126 are classified as "climate endangered," meaning they are projected to lose more than 50 percent of their current range by 2050 if global warming continues at its current pace.
Even common birds not listed in the Audubon study could vanish from our region due to climatic stress. The black-capped chickadee, Stotz said, could vacate Illinois, moving north as temperatures rise.
Avian visitors we look forward to seeing only in winter may no longer "drop down." If you are lucky enough to see a redpoll, a crossbill or northern shrike this winter, savor the experience. Spotting these and other species in the Chicago region may become significantly more challenging.
Sorry, that's the birder in me coming out again. Climate change is not about birding, of course. It's about the gradual disruption of ecosystems and all the flora and fauna that depend on those systems being in balance.
The global climate talks in Paris last month yielded a glimmer of optimism. We'll see.
"It's easy to feel overwhelmed," Audubon's President and CEO David Yarnold wrote more than a year ago, and I'll bet he feels the same way today. Don't we all?
For those who study birds, there is hope. Through effective habitat management, Stotz thinks the bobolink and other vulnerable species can be saved.
"One of the big things we can do to fight climate change is to get our natural areas into the best condition possible," he said. "There is no question that birds in a healthy environment can hold on in the face of climate change much better than if they are already stressed."

BARCELONA, Spain — Climate change could push more than 200 million people to leave their homes in the next three decades and create migration hot spots unless urgent action is taken to reduce global emissions and bridge the development gap, a World Bank report has found. The second part of the Groundswell report published Monday examined how the impacts of slow-onset climate change such as water scarcity, decreasing crop productivity and rising sea levels could lead to millions of what it describes as "climate migrants" by 2050 under three different scenarios with varying degrees of climate action and development. Under the most pessimistic scenario, with a high level of emissions and unequal development, the report forecasts up to 216 million people moving within their own countries across the six regions analyzed. 
Those regions are Latin America, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and East Asia and the Pacific. In the most climate-friendly scenario, with a low level of emissions and inclusive, sustainable development, the world could still see 44 million people being forced to leave their homes. The findings "reaffirm the potency of climate to induce migration within countries," said Viviane Wei Chen Clement, a senior climate change specialist at the World Bank and one of the report's authors. The report didn't look at the short-term impacts of climate change, such as the effects of extreme weather events, and did not look at climate migration across borders. In the worst-case scenario, sub-Saharan Africa — the most vulnerable region due to desertification, fragile coastlines and the population's dependence on agriculture — would see the most migrants, with up to 86 million people moving within national borders. North Africa, however, is predicted to have the largest proportion of climate migrants, with 19 million people moving, equivalent to roughly 9% of its population, due mainly to increased water scarcity in northeastern Tunisia, northwestern Algeria, western and southern Morocco, and the central Atlas foothills, the report said. In South Asia, Bangladesh is particularly affected by flooding and crop failures, accounting for almost half of the predicted climate migrants, with 19.9 million people, including an increasing number of women, moving by 2050 under the pessimistic scenario. "This is our humanitarian reality right now and we are concerned this is going to be even worse, where vulnerability is more acute," said Maarten van Aalst, director of the International Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, who wasn't involved with the report. Many scientists say the world is no longer on track to the worst-case scenario for emissions. But even under a more moderate scenario, van Aalst said many impacts are now occurring faster than previously expected, "including the extremes we are already experiencing, as well as potential implications for migration and displacement."

Talking with children about climate change

Your children may have questions about the changing climate. Many are hearing about or experiencing climate-change-fueled disasters such as wildfires and severe storms. Climate change affects everyone, but it impacts kids the most. Children are especially vulnerable to environmental health harms because they are still growing and have higher exposure to air, food and water based on weight. 
While the climate crisis can feel like an overwhelming topic, there are healthy ways to talk with kids about it. We can communicate in a way that is honest, hopeful, developmentally appropriate, and action oriented. By helping kids understand the issue of climate change and how it affects their health and futures, we empower them to make a difference. For toddlers and children under 5, it's a perfect time to introduce them the joys of nature. Parents may take walks to show how weather affects nature. Talk about how weather makes the seasons. You can point out bird nests, for example, and talk about how weather influences when and where birds make their nests. Talk about other wild animals and discuss how they all have homes that need protecting. Young children also enjoy gardening. Pick out fruit, vegetable or flower seeds to plant in your garden, or herbs to plant in kitchen boxes. Young children can help take care of plants, and get excited seeing something grow from nothing. Talk about how your child needs air to breathe and so do plants and animals. When pollutants get in the air, that affects their health. Point out local effects of climate change depending on your location. Some areas may be more prone to wildfires, hurricanes and floods, while others may experience longer and more intense heat waves or an increase in illness from mosquitoes and ticks. As children grow older, parents may begin explaining concepts behind climate change in simple scientific terms. Ask children what they know and fill in blanks or research it together. NASA has online resources to help parents go through each aspect of climate change. Families may also discuss how personal choices can affect the environment and show respect for nature. Calculate your family's carbon footprint together and ask them how they suggest lowering it. Examples might include turning lights off after leaving the room, biking or walking or taking public transit or carpooling when possible. Families may choose to eat a more plant-based diet. Explain how people — including kids — can be powerful forces in protecting the environment. Point out that choices we make can help make our planet, and people, healthier. Because teens are more aware of how issues may influence all aspects of their lives, you can discuss how climate change affects our economy and society. This can spark scientific curiosity and introduce the idea of civic responsibility. Pick a recent or ongoing event and discuss how climate change might have contributed to the event and its economic effects. For example, families can talk with their teen about how climate change is causing longer and more severe wildfires in California, resulting in the loss of homes and businesses. Discuss how it is also causing air pollution that forces people indoors. Consider the mental health effects all of this can have on families. Families might also explore how climate change doesn't affect everyone equally, and the ways some communities experience more health risks. Discuss how everyone should have an equal opportunity to clean air and water. Encourage your teen to come up with solutions and creative ways to express their ideas. They might use a science class presentation or a school, Scouts, 4-H or other project to educate peers about the need for climate change solutions. They could also form a club at school and brainstorm how to help the local community, write for a local or state newspaper on why teens care about the climate or join a national youth advocacy organization. Work together to make changes at home, incorporating your teen's ideas. Participate in advocacy as a family and pace your discussions to help prevent stress and anxiety. When disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes happen, be sure to limit your child's media use to cut down on the amount of distressing footage they see and hear on the news. Take nature breaks when possible. When you talk with your child, stay hopeful and focused on solutions. We have tools to take climate action right now, remind them, and these can have immediate benefits for our health. Even if the climate crisis is accelerating, emphasize that together we can clean up our air and water and reduce our carbon footprint. Parents are role models and can think about ways to advocate for a healthier environment for children. They can ask the school district to incorporate a climate curriculum, share news of climate advocacy work and reach out to local, state and federal legislators to encourage climate action. Kids are the next generation of innovators and thinkers. Youth leadership is already making a huge difference. If we nurture a love for the environment early, children may just come up with the best solutions. Don't be surprised if they teach you something, too, along the way. * Dr. Steph Lee is a pediatrician, preventive medicine specialist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Your children may have questions about the changing climate. Many are hearing about or experiencing climate-change-fueled disasters such as wildfires and severe storms. Climate change affects everyone, but it impacts kids the most. Children are especially vulnerable to environmental health harms because they are still growing and have higher exposure to air, food and water based on weight. 
While the climate crisis can feel like an overwhelming topic, there are healthy ways to talk with kids about it. We can communicate in a way that is honest, hopeful, developmentally appropriate, and action oriented. By helping kids understand the issue of climate change and how it affects their health and futures, we empower them to make a difference. For toddlers and children under 5, it's a perfect time to introduce them the joys of nature. Parents may take walks to show how weather affects nature. Talk about how weather makes the seasons. You can point out bird nests, for example, and talk about how weather influences when and where birds make their nests. Talk about other wild animals and discuss how they all have homes that need protecting. Young children also enjoy gardening. Pick out fruit, vegetable or flower seeds to plant in your garden, or herbs to plant in kitchen boxes. Young children can help take care of plants, and get excited seeing something grow from nothing. Talk about how your child needs air to breathe and so do plants and animals. When pollutants get in the air, that affects their health. Point out local effects of climate change depending on your location. Some areas may be more prone to wildfires, hurricanes and floods, while others may experience longer and more intense heat waves or an increase in illness from mosquitoes and ticks. As children grow older, parents may begin explaining concepts behind climate change in simple scientific terms. Ask children what they know and fill in blanks or research it together. NASA has online resources to help parents go through each aspect of climate change. Families may also discuss how personal choices can affect the environment and show respect for nature. Calculate your family's carbon footprint together and ask them how they suggest lowering it. Examples might include turning lights off after leaving the room, biking or walking or taking public transit or carpooling when possible. Families may choose to eat a more plant-based diet. Explain how people — including kids — can be powerful forces in protecting the environment. Point out that choices we make can help make our planet, and people, healthier. Because teens are more aware of how issues may influence all aspects of their lives, you can discuss how climate change affects our economy and society. This can spark scientific curiosity and introduce the idea of civic responsibility. Pick a recent or ongoing event and discuss how climate change might have contributed to the event and its economic effects. For example, families can talk with their teen about how climate change is causing longer and more severe wildfires in California, resulting in the loss of homes and businesses. Discuss how it is also causing air pollution that forces people indoors. Consider the mental health effects all of this can have on families. Families might also explore how climate change doesn't affect everyone equally, and the ways some communities experience more health risks. Discuss how everyone should have an equal opportunity to clean air and water. Encourage your teen to come up with solutions and creative ways to express their ideas.

Peggy Notebaert museum exhibit drives home climate change

Peggy Notebaert museum exhibit drives home climate change
Climate change can be hard for people to understand because humans are adaptable. But other life-forms aren't so lucky.
"We don't have to shiver or pant, we can just change the AC," said Steve Sullivan, senior curator of urban ecology for the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. "Other species can't do that. Change from a biological standpoint is impossible for most organisms. If this summer is half a degree warmer, climatologists are going to freak out but homeowners won't notice a difference."
The museum is helping to educate visitors on the causes and effects of climate change, and how they can help, through the exhibit "Weather to Climate: Our Changing World," which runs in Chicago through Oct. 23 before heading out on tour.
"Climate change is really the defining issue of our time, and we saw that as an issue that we as an institution could address," Sullivan said. "We also noticed that a lot of museums rent traveling exhibits that address pressing issues, but oddly there are no really good, moderately sized traveling exhibits on climate change."
The exhibit opens by explaining the difference between weather and climate, letting kids play dress up in front of a mirror to see how their clothes may change frequently, like the weather. But climate — like a person's wardrobe — is typically consistent over time, depending on where you live. Residents of Hawaii, for example, might wear heavy jackets on occasion, but their overall wardrobe will be lighter than if they lived in Chicago.
"If you look at the political debate, a lot of times we conflate weather and climate," Sullivan said. "The weather you are experiencing at this moment is a data point. It's really kind of irrelevant. That collection of data points that are studied over 30 years equals a meaningful climate data point. When we look at that overall picture, not just what's happening today or yesterday, is when we can really see what's going on."
Kids can also take on the role of a meteorologist, donning suit jackets, standing in front of a green screen in a mock television studio and reading weather reports off a teleprompter while they see themselves amid graphics.
"At the most superficial level you're just interacting with this goofy, fun thing and seeing pictures of weather," Sullivan said. "At the most sophisticated level the text is informing the audience of how weather and climate are changing and how this affects people."
The middle section of the exhibit addresses the effects of climate change using mounted specimens of red and gray squirrels as an example.
Kids can also spin a wheel of fortune showing different animals and weather conditions they could be exposed to. A video then explains the potential effects. For instance the pika, a miniature rabbit with short ears, lives in high elevations and wouldn't mind colder temperatures. But pikas — who spend cold months eating stores of hay — would not get enough food to survive the winter if it was too wet.
"These specific plants and animals are adapted to specific climactic regimes," Sullivan said. "As those climates change, those animals may be able to adapt, they may be able to move. But most things that have to adapt to change in the world simply go extinct."
The exhibit ends by exploring how humans are impacting climate change. A sculpture incorporates 94 balls, each filled with a cubic foot of air to represent the amount of carbon dioxide the average American puts out in a day through the burning of fossil fuels.
By following tips for reducing their carbon footprint, visitors can help prevent climate change from getting worse.
"We want to end on a note that empowers people and, importantly, we want to end on a positive note that makes them feel like they can make a difference," Sullivan said.

Pentagon revised Obama-era report to remove risks from climate change

WASHINGTON — Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. 
The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion — that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems — results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise — a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas, from the sprawling naval base in Norfolk to the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site in the Pacific's remote Marshall Islands. Seas are currently rising by about 3.2 millimeters per year, and scientists fear the rise could accelerate in coming decades. The final Pentagon document even omits, in several cases, the simple observation that learning about bases' vulnerability to sea-level rise was a core part of the survey that is the subject of the report. That survey itself asked each military site how much of its area was located at elevations between 0-3, 0-6, 0-9, or 0-12 feet above sea level. The final document also removes a map showing "those sites that indicated possible effects could occur due to increased mean sea level between 0-3 feet." (A few references to sea-level rise do remain in the final version of the report and in the survey questions themselves, contained in an appendix.) "The wordsmithing, not saying ‘climate,' I could live with that," said Dennis McGinn, a retired Navy vice admiral who served as assistant secretary of the Navy for energy, installations and environment in the Obama administration, when some of the changes were described to him. "But taking out ... maps of critical areas of flooding, that's pretty fundamental. And the Arctic, that's huge, for a lot of reasons, not just for Department of Defense, but for the Coast Guard, and commercial shipping business." The report emerged from a process commenced by the previous administration, as officials in Washington sought to get a sense of how climate-related phenomena could affect military installations dotting the globe. President Barack Obama's focus on climate change created a sense of urgency for federal agencies, including the behemoth Defense Department, to prepare for its effects. The published version removes a reference to the National Climate Assessment, which the U.S. government, by law, undertakes every four years. It also omits several references to the decline of Arctic sea ice, an ongoing phenomenon that has been strongly attributed to climate change. One such case is found in a description of conditions at the Cape Lisburne radar station on Alaska's North Slope. A statement that "the past decades have seen a climate-related downward trend in the extent of Arctic sea ice coverage" does not appear in the final report, nor does a description of extreme weather events being "made more destructive by a reduction in sea ice and an increase in ice free periods," since without protective sea ice, large waves can pummel fragile Arctic coastlines during storms. And where the draft report says that shoreline erosion at the site is caused by "reduced sea ice coverage," the final document instead blames the damage on "sea ice fluctuations." In another omitted section, the draft document addresses ways in which a changing climate could affect the ability to train troops. "The changing climate could increase risk to the 420 endangered species that live on our installations, potentially leading to training and operating restrictions," the omitted section reads. "Increased high-heat days limit the training and testing activities our personnel can safely perform without appropriate rest periods," it continues. The survey at the center of the report, in its various versions, asked military installations a battery of detailed questions about different extreme events that have affected them, along with requesting information about installations' elevation and vulnerability to sea level rise. Among the questions asked were: — "Has your installation been negatively impacted by wind?" — "Has your installation been negatively impacted by extreme hot or cold temperatures?" — "What might be negatively impacted/degraded with an increase of 0 to 12 feet in mean sea level?" Current and former officials said that the wording and content of the report was unlikely to have a bearing on how the military services respond — or do not respond — to climate change. In some ways, the military has been seen as proactive in its attitude to climate issues, seeking to protect infrastructure in places such as Norfolk from changing weather, producing a massive climate change "road map" and planning for changes in the Arctic. In other ways, however, the military has taken only modest action as it operates its massive network of power-intensive bases and air, ship and vehicle fleets, and provides food and housing to its personnel around the world. "I think in DOD, there is generally a belief, it's more important what you do than to fight about how you talk about it," said Jeffrey Marqusee, a former director of environmental and energy research and development at the office of the secretary of defense. "It's not like they've generally been in denial mode," said Sherri Goodman, who served as deputy undersecretary of defense for environmental security in the Clinton administration. "They've generally been pretty forthcoming."

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do?

I'm having a hard time coping with scary climate change news. What should I do? Dear Sara: I recently read the climate change report out of Australia — "Existential climate-related security risk: A scenario approach" — and I am having a hard time coping with its implications. I'm in my late 20s, I work for a consulting group that helps companies switch to clean energy sources, and I am typically an optimistic person. I know that our world is not in a good place, but I have always been hopeful that by working together we will find a way to fix it. 
After reading this piece, though, I do not know what to do. Assuming it's true that human civilization as we know it could very likely come to an end by 2050, it's hard to focus on staying positive. How can we fight against the economic and political systems in place in the U.S. so that we get results, instead of feeling resigned to the way things are now? How do we stay positive here? I'm not sure if that's a question or a cry for help, but I hope there is a good question in there. — Courtney in New York City Dear Courtney, My answer might seem contradictory at first, so bear with me. I don't find that Australian report very credible. But I also think you're right to fear for the future. And it's worth taking steps to address that feeling — more on that in a bit. About that Australian climate change report For readers who missed it, in May 2019, an Australian think tank published an 11-page paper by former fossil fuel executive Ian Dunlop and book author David Spratt. In their paper, Dunlop and Spratt outline a scenario in which the world does not swiftly reduce global warming pollution. By 2050, in their scenario, coral reefs and the Amazon ecosystem collapse, deadly heat displaces more than 1 billion people, and food prices skyrocket. Dire social consequences ensue, including armed conflict, pandemics, and outright chaos. The paper, which was not peer-reviewed, provoked immediate criticism from climate scientists, who challenged both the report and resulting news articles claiming that human civilization could end within 30 years. "This is a classic case of a media article overstating the conclusions and significance of a non-peer-reviewed report that itself had already overstated (and indeed misrepresented) peer-reviewed science," climate scientist Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre, wrote in a critique of a news article on the paper. "(T) he report's authors have merely read (or possibly seen without actually reading) a few of the scariest papers they could find, misunderstood (or not read properly) at least one of them, and presented unjustified statements," Betts said. Penn State scientist Michael Mann — who has endured intense harassment over his work on climate change — also called the think tank report exaggerated. "I respect the authors and appreciate that their intentions are good, but as I have written before, overblown rhetoric, exaggeration, and unsupportable doomist framing can be counteractive to climate action," he told NewScientist. You can read more about the controversy over the Australian paper in this Vox explainer: "Is climate change an ‘existential threat' — or just a catastrophic one?" The case for worrying about the climate Even if you don't buy the idea that civilization is going to outright collapse, there is plenty of mainstream, peer-reviewed research indicating that climate change is likely to cause enormous suffering this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the organization of scientists that issues periodic reports on climate science, is sometimes accused of being too conservative in its assessments. But even a recent IPCC report warns that an additional 0.5 degree Celsius of warming — on top of the roughly 1 degree the world has already warmed — could kill 70-90% of the world's coral reefs, cause annual global fish catches to fall by 1.5 million tons, and increase the risks to "health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth." And according to the IPCC, warming the planet by an additional 0.5 degree C is actually the best-case scenario. Unless the world cuts global warming pollution swiftly — by about 45% below 2010 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050 — the planet is likely to warm by more than 0.5 degree C, unleashing even more harm to people and the global community of species. Yikes! Courtney, you asked how to stay positive in light of frightening information about the climate. What if you … didn't? What would happen if you allowed yourself to feel the full force of your fear, sorrow, anger, or despair? "Respect and honor your feelings," said Margaret Klein Salamon, who holds a doctoral degree in clinical psychology and is the author of Facing the Climate Emergency, a book due out next spring. She is also the executive director of The Climate Mobilization, a nonprofit calling for a World War II-scale mobilization to rapidly slash global warming pollution. "They make sense. They are based in reality. They are based in your love for this world and for humanity." "You want to be a robot who doesn't care that all life is threatened? Hell, no," she said. Trebbe Johnson, the author of Radical Joy for Hard Times, also encourages acceptance of despair and grief about environmental destruction. "Recognize that you can't always change things in the moment," she said. "That kind of acceptance does not mean submission or capitulation. It simply means that you ground yourself in what is, so that you can move to the next step." So what is that next step? Consider these suggestions. Get informed, but recognize the psychological toll Patrick Houston, an organizer with New York Communities for Change, recently helped pass a bill to slash climate pollution associated with buildings in New York City. He said the first step to coping with climate despair is to learn more about the issue. He acknowledged that staying up-to-date with climate news can be daunting: "That comes at the emotional cost of constantly reading about the terrible situation that we've gotten ourselves into and how we're digging the hole deeper," he said. So he suggested choosing just one source to follow consistently. One option: InsideClimate News, the Pulitzer Prize-winning news site focusing on climate and energy. Houston also recommended identifying your elected officials at the local, state, and federal level. What do they say about climate change? Votesmart.org is one place to research a politician's stance on the issue. Connect with others Salamon said it's common for people who are knowledgeable about climate change to feel alienated from others. They might experience thoughts like, "No one understands. No one wants to talk about it. I'm kind of sitting here all alone with this horrible information." Not true. Nearly 70% of American adults are worried about climate change, making it a mainstream concern. Try talking about your fears with friends, family, or people in your community who are working to address the problem. "There is true relief in the fellowship of others who understand and who are grieving," Salamon said. Commit to action The next step, Houston said, is civic engagement. It's can be easy to feel cynical about U.S. politics. But Houston said it's important for people to understand that elected officials do in fact pay close attention to their constituents. "Some of those small actions that might not feel like a lot — sending a letter, signing onto a letter, calling your elected official, standing in the street for a rally or protest — even if it doesn't feel like a lot, they should know that elected officials pay a lot of attention to that, even if they don't always listen," he said. His other advice: Volunteer at a level that you can sustain over time. Many people can find time to get involved with one organization, but not a dozen. "It can be less overwhelming if you're just zoned in and focused on one goal rather than freaking out and trying to address every single part of the climate crisis by spreading yourself thin and volunteering with a bunch of different organizations," he said. Seek reasons for hope "What we're dealing with is horrible, but it is calling on us to be better," Salamon said. She said she takes inspiration from reading about how Americans responded to World War II. After the shocking attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. rapidly transformed its economy to produce goods for the war effort. People grew vegetables in victory gardens. Gasoline, meat, sugar, and other commodities were rationed, "which by and large Americans accepted cheerfully as part of the war effort," she said. There are advantages to that kind of mentality, she said: "It's actually a much better way of living to be working with your neighbors and your whole society for a common purpose." And unlike the case of a world war, she added, "This time, we don't need to kill anybody." * Sarah Kennedy contributed reporting.

If you're like us, when the tornado warnings were going out across the suburbs last week, along with several days of stormy weather, you may have wondered: Is this one more symptom of climate change? That's impossible to answer with any precision. We have had tornadoes and stormy weeks before. 
It's hard to pinpoint the cause of any single weather event. But what is clear is that extreme weather — like the record heat waves, horrific wildfires and unprecedented flooding that have ravaged spots all around the globe this summer — is a hallmark of this undeniable change. What is becoming painfully clear is that climate change is not some distant threat. Climate change is here. Now. And the impact of it is only going to get worse. It's going to get worse even if we do something about it. All we're left with now is to minimize how much worse it gets. If we do nothing or next to nothing, if we continue to kid ourselves that it's just part of the natural ebb and flow of the planet's weather, well, then it will become a catastrophe. If we all have not been alarmed by the myriad examples of extreme weather so far in 2021, we should be by the report released last week by the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Its report on the state of the worldwide environment warns that world leaders must act immediately to reduce human reliance on fossil fuels or risk significant growth of extreme weather events. But this is not just a matter for world leaders and politicians. It is an existential challenge that calls on all of us to do our parts. Some responses will be easy. Some will be hard. All must be done. We must reduce the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and we must make wise choices in how we adapt to the climate change that already has been set in motion. The U.N. panel said scientists are observing irrefutable climate changes in every region of the planet. "Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion — such as continued sea level rise — are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years," the panel said. Left unchecked, these changes will affect virtually everything about human life as well as the lives of other animals who share the planet with us: Our water and food supplies, sea levels, where and how we live, our health, our economies, virtually everything. "We just barely have the time," U.S. Rep. Sean Casten of Downers Grove said. "Our moment is right now to do what's necessary." We can pretend no longer.

World Bank: Climate change could result in 100 million poor

STOCKHOLM — Climate change could push more than 100 million people into extreme poverty by 2030 by disrupting agriculture and fueling the spread of malaria and other diseases, the World Bank said in a report Sunday.
Released just weeks ahead of a U.N. climate summit in Paris, the report highlighted how the impact of global warming is borne unevenly, with the world's poor woefully unprepared to deal with climate shocks such as rising seas or severe droughts.
"They have fewer resources and receive less support from family, community, the financial system, and even social safety nets to prevent, cope and adapt," the Washington-based World Bank said.
How to help poor countries — and poor communities within countries — deal with climate change is one of the crunch issues in talks on a global climate accord that's supposed to be adopted next month in Paris.
Those who say that rich countries aren't doing enough to help the poor said the report added emphasis to demands for billions of dollars in so-called climate finance to developing countries.
"The statistics in the World Bank report are suitably shocking and I hope they force world leaders to sit up and take notice," said Mohamed Adow of Christian Aid. "The Paris deal needs to support the poor and vulnerable communities to cope with unavoidable climate crises better, and to be more resilient to a changed climate."
Despite pledges to rein in emissions of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases, climate change isn't likely to stop anytime soon. Carbon emissions are expected to rise for many years as China, India and other developing countries expand the use of fossil fuels to power their economies.
But efforts to protect the poor, such as generally improving access to health care and social safety nets, and targeted measures to upgrade flood defenses and deploy more heat-tolerant crops could prevent most of the negative consequences of climate change on poverty, the bank said.
"Absent such good development, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030," the report said.
Stephane Hallegatte, one of the authors, said one of the unique features of the report was that instead of analyzing the macroeconomic impact of climate change it was based in part on surveys of 1.4 million people in 92 countries.
"When we ask people why they fall into poverty there are three major factors," he said. "Agricultural shocks, including an increase in food prices; natural disasters such as floods, droughts, storms; and health issues, including malaria, diarrhea."
The report referred to studies showing climate change could result in global crop yield losses as large as 5 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2080. It also referenced studies showing warming temperatures could increase the number of people at risk for malaria by 150 million.
Hallegatte said the "hot spots" for climate impacts on poor people were sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The U.S. and other countries have collectively pledged to scale up climate financing to developed countries to $100 billion annually by 2020 to help them adapt to climate change and reduce their emissions.
Developing countries are calling for commitments beyond 2020 in the Paris agreement but rich nations are reluctant to make firm promises, in part due to budget uncertainties.
A recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated climate finance flows to developing countries reached $62 billion in 2014.w

A local effort to tackle climate change Climate: Power plant operator says changes have been made

Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

Lake County restoration project to see if native grasses are key to dealing with climate change

Restoring landscapes to their native state is a regular practice for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, but a pending project at Grant Woods in Ingleside has the added aspect of climate change as a key element. In late October or early November, more than 800 pounds of native grass seed will be sown over 180 acres of what had been rolling agricultural fields east of Route 59 and north of Monaville Road. Two thirds of the land will be sown with seed "sourced" farther south than normally would be the case to determine whether it will be a better choice for future restorations as climate change progresses. "We know that by 2050, our climate is predicted to be more like Oklahoma," said Pati Vitt, manager of restoration ecology for the forest preserve district and originator of the "Growing Through Change" project. 
"This is more what I consider a demonstration project to see how we are sourcing seeds," Vitt added. "Should we be sourcing farther south and if so, how much farther south?" Along with the grasses, sedges will be planted in wetland areas on the site. Flowering plants will follow in fall 2021. The area is one part of an ongoing restoration at Grant Woods, which covers 1,226 acres. The broader effort has been facilitated by donations of more than $1.1 million to the Preservation Foundation of the Lake County Forest Preserves by a couple with long, personal ties to the land but who wish to remain anonymous, according to Rebekah Snyder, executive director. Some of that money, along with a $216,000 grant from the national Wildlife Conservation Society Climate Adaptation Fund, will be used for the $350,000 farmland restoration. "It's not just putting native seed on this agricultural parcel," Snyder said. "What we wanted to do was take a climate change model and put it on top of that." Vitt, who came to the forest district nearly two years ago, had been curator of the seed bank collection at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She's been considering the effects of climate change on native plant populations and seeds being used for 15 years or more. The restoration community long has grappled with this complex issue, and the Grant Woods project presents an opportunity to compare a new strategy with standard practice to determine what might work best going forward, according to Vitt. "This is a highly different approach," she said. "The concern might be if we don't keep up with that quickly changing climate, we could find in 20 years the plants in our natural areas aren't producing well enough." Because many species of pollinators respond to temperature, while plants respond to the length of the daylight, the two could get out of sync as the average temperature increases, according to Vitt. The district will monitor how the southern grasses survive, grow and reproduce, and whether their use will be more successful than standard strategies. "We can grow most anything but will it handle the new climate that's coming?" said Ken Klick, the forest district's site ecologist for Grant Woods. "Plants from farther south may be favored in this changing climate in the future," he added. "Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas — those would be the areas we're pinpointing," for grass seed. While climate models appear to be accurate in projecting what the changes will be, timing is less certain, Vitt said. That means the project runs the risk of sourcing too far south for current conditions. "We simply don't know," she said. "There have been few, if any, demonstration projects at this scale to explore this." Vitt says the research is needed to protect plant vitality and protect native ecosystems, and also provide fresh "marketplace opportunities" for retailers and consumers. It also could become a key seed source for other entities in the future, Klick noted. "This may be one of the most valuable restorations in the region 50 years from now," he said.

Pentagon revises report, removes ‘climate change' and some effects

WASHINGTON — Internal changes to a draft Defense Department report de-emphasized the threats climate change poses to military bases and installations, muting or removing references to climate-driven changes in the Arctic and potential risks from rising seas, an unpublished draft obtained by The Washington Post reveals. The earlier version of the document, dated December 2016, contains numerous references to "climate change" that were omitted or altered to "extreme weather" or simply "climate" in the final report, which was submitted to Congress in January 2018. While the phrase "climate change" appears 23 separate times in the draft report, the final version used it just once. Those and other edits suggest the Pentagon has adapted its approach to public discussion of climate change under President Donald Trump, who has expressed doubt about the reality of a phenomenon that scientists agree presents an increasing danger to the planet. 
While military leaders have said they see a changing climate as a driver of instability worldwide, they have also sought to stay out of a politically charged debate about its causes. Heather Babb, a Pentagon spokeswoman, declined to comment on the draft report, which outlines the results of the department's first-ever survey of officials at different installations about the effects of climate change. The Post was not able to verify who made the changes reflected in the two documents. "As highlighted in the report, the effects of climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to missions, operational plans, and installations," Babb said in a statement. "DOD continues to focus on ensuring its installations and infrastructure are resilient to a wide range of threats, including climate. The Department has a proven record of planning and preparing for such threats." According to John Conger, who served as a senior Pentagon official under the Obama administration and was among the officials who initiated the multi-base survey that forms the basis of the report, employees from a dozen different Defense Department offices could have made changes to the text as it made its way through the bureaucracy's clearance process, which often makes for "lowest common denominator" documents. Conger said the alterations "change the feeling of urgency in the report, but not its fundamental conclusion — that our military installations are clearly experiencing climate impacts." The final document, a 32-page report to Congress, was published more than a year after the earlier draft. It, like its earlier version, finds that out of more than 3,500 military sites around the world, 782 reported being affected by drought, 763 by major wind events, and 706 by flooding, along with other problems — results that drew considerable attention when they debuted in late January. But the December 2016 draft was far more direct in its discussion of climate change and in particular the issue of sea-level rise — a well-known problem facing many military sites in coastal areas.

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change

14th District candidates back green energy but far apart on climate change Both candidates for the 14th Congressional District support the pursuit of green energy, but climate change is a different story. Incumbent Republican Randy Hultgren has a polar opposite perspective from his Democratic challenger, Lauren Underwood, when it comes to what's fueling climate change and steps taken to address it so far. Hultgren joined the bipartisan, 74-member Climate Solutions Caucus in April. The mission of the caucus is to explore economically-viable options to "reduce climate risk" and work on legislation that can "address the impacts, causes and challenges of our changing climate" and also receive bipartisan support when it comes time for a vote. 
In announcing his admission into the caucus, Hultgren pointed to his interest in modernizing Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab, and giving Illinois' communities choices in where their energy comes from as his motivation. St. Charles' work with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency to bring solar power to the area is a prime example of creating such choice. In written interviews subsequent to the caucus announcement, Hultgren indicated he is not on board with all the stances his new caucus members take when it comes to climate change. For one, the caucus pushed President Donald Trump to maintain the United States' commitment to the Paris climate accord. Hultgren does not support that agreement. "I don't support climate change policies that place American workers behind the rest of the world," Hultgren said. "The Paris agreement hurt American workers and allowed Chinese factories to keep polluting at extremely high levels." Part of Hultgren's objection to the Paris agreement stems from what he views as a "flawed premise" in the Clean Power Plan that Trump administration officials are trying to repeal. The plan is considered former President Barack Obama's signature climate change policy. It created new rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. power plants. Hultgren said the plan was not "grounded in law and the Constitution" and he believes it will not withstand a legal challenge. Hultgren said encouraging new, cleaner energy production is a better method to reduce carbon pollution than punishing users of less clean forms. "The carrot is better than the stick, and federal R & D (research and development) will help emerging technologies to get to the point of adoption," he said. Underwood takes the opposite view. In a written interview, she said pulling out of the Paris agreement was "a mistake." "We ceded our international leadership role, and we are not unable to achieve an important multilateral goal of reducing emissions," she said. She believes the Clean Power Plan was "a strong step" to curb carbon pollution and reduce methane from the oil and gas industry. "The Trump Administration's attempt to dismantle the Clean Power Plan is hazardous to our planet and is an economic and environmental threat to our country," Underwood said. Neither candidate directly answered a question about whether they support any form of a tax on carbon polluters. Likewise, when asked how much humans have contributed to climate change, Hultgren said there "are a number of contributing factors." "Humans have certainly polluted the earth, and it is our responsibility to develop cleaner technologies," he said. "I teach my kids we are stewards of the earth, and we have a responsibility toward it." Underwood said she believes the science to date includes clear evidence "that human activity is a significant catalyst toward climate change, producing increased carbon emissions that have caused lasting damage to our planet."

Clean Energy Jobs Act primed to confront climate change in IL

Illinois needs to take the reins toward a clean energy future now and charge forward in the fight against climate change. While Bidenâ€™s administration has swiftly mobilized a national team to combat climate change, climate action in Illinois has been put on hold, seemingly indefinitely. But climate change wonâ€™t wait around for us to get our act together, and inaction has consequences. While the state legislature keeps its residents on standby, Illinoisans statewide have come together to demand action. 
For a few years now, the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition (a statewide grassroots coalition of organizations composed of energy experts, Illinois consumers, climate and environmental justice advocates, and more) has worked tirelessly on drafting the Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA). To do this, the coalition proactively sought out input from dozens of communities and asked them about their needs, concerns and hopes. CEJA is now a 900-page comprehensive climate action bill that is geared toward enabling a just transition to renewable energy across Illinois. Its predecessor - the Future Energy Jobs Act (FEJA) - was passed with bipartisan support in December 2016 by requiring greater energy efficiency, creating workforce development programs and increasing access to renewable energy. It required ComEd to develop and enhance customer efficiency programs to cut electricity waste by approximately 22% and Ameren by 16% by 2030 - providing critical incentives for companies to meet and exceed their targets. But FEJA on its own is not enough. CEJA is the only legislation currently before Springfield that could yield consumer savings, hold notorious Illinois utility companies accountable to consumers, require fossil fuel energy providers to pay for the pollution theyâ€™ve created (aka not leaving taxpayers to foot the bill), while increasing energy efficiency standards to more effective levels and maximizing benefits from lowered cost of wind and solar. CEJA aligns regulation with state and customer priorities, ensuring that electric utilities actually serve the public interest and operate transparently. For example, CEJA promises to protect Illinois from a federal regulatory ruling that could slap an additional $1.7B onto Illinois consumersâ€™ energy bills over the next ten years (money which, per the federal ruling, would go to bail out the fossil fuel industry). The merits of CEJA donâ€™t stop there. CEJA contains provisions to transition displaced fossil fuel workers into clean energy jobs, and it designates communities that lose a fossil fuel plant or coal mine as â€œClean Energy Empowerment Zones,â€ providing local governments in these zones a tax base replacement to recover from any lost revenues due to closures. CEJA emphasizes the need for an equitable and diverse workforce, dedicating nearly $100M annually toward workforce development and Illinois Solar for All. CEJA is a critical climate action bill for the state because it targets carbon emissions - a central factor contributing to climate change - by incentivizing zero-to-low carbon renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels, and it does so by addressing numerous cross-cutting issues faced by Illinoisans statewide, including Lake County residents. For example, Lake County has an â€œFâ€ from the American Lung Association. By shifting away from dirty energy sources, like coal-powered plants still operating in our region, Lake County residents have a chance to breathe cleaner air and, thus, be relieved of the prime contributing factors to increased respiratory issues (such as asthma) in the area. Climate action is non-negotiable. Whether we want to or not, everyone will be tasked with making climate-imposed decisions that affect their families, friends, communities, states, and neighbors over the coming years. However, if we act in time and we act in a manner that comprehensively addresses the intersectional issues that climate action comprises, we can come out ahead. By passing CEJA, Illinois can lead the renewable energy transition in a way that leaves no one behind. While originally introduced in the state legislature in early 2019 (but postponed due to COVID-19), CEJA was reintroduced this past week. Itâ€™s time to hold our elected officials accountable to take critical steps forward and ensure that CEJA will be passed this year. You can learn more about CEJA at the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition website (www.ilcleanjobs.org) and contact your state representatives to demand they sponsor the bill today. Even if they are a sponsor, you can thank them for signing on and ask them to make passing CEJA a priority.

Lake County leaders pledge to tackle climate change Addressing climate change is at a critical point, according to Lake County leaders and environmentalists who rallied on the Lake Michigan shore Saturday to launch an initiative aimed at combating the issue locally. Extensive flooding in Lake County last month is one example of the destructive consequences of a "climate on steroids" that can't be ignored, said Julio Cesar Guzman, an organizer with the Sierra Club, a national grass-roots environmental group. "We saw the impact of climate change. It was a burdensome reality," he said in advance of Saturday's event in Waukegan. 
Local action is critical because the federal government has "abdicated its role in climate leadership," according to the Sierra Club. Lake County Board Chairman Aaron Lawlor joined supporters in introducing the Lake County Climate Action Pledge, which urges community leaders and officials to take bipartisan action on the what was described as a climate crisis. "If we get a coalition of county, state and federal leaders, we can bite off a piece of that challenge," Lawlor said. The initiative was introduced in front of the NRG Energy Inc., coal-fired power plant, as part of Clean Power Lake County's fourth annual beach rally and cleanup. The pledge has three "pillars": Move Lake County beyond coal, adopt ambitious clean energy goals, and build climate-resilient infrastructure. Those goals do not suggest specific measures but are designed to encourage local officials to minimize environmental impacts when considering projects. "How are we building in a smart way that will mitigate the next big rain event?" Guzman explained. Any initiative will include closing the NRG plant, he said. The facility, which produces enough electricity to serve the needs of about 668,000 households, has been a target in recent years for Clean Power Lake County because of air and water emissions. "No one can say we want to tackle climate change knowing it's catalyzed by carbon emissions," Guzman said. "It needs to be addressed." NRG spokesman David Gaier said the company has invested $107 million in additional emission controls at the Waukegan plant and the company meets all laws and regulations. "We promised to modernize the plant and make it cleaner and greener, and that's what we've done," he said. The Waukegan plant produces electricity for a grid covering 13 states and Washington, D.C. Investments there and elsewhere in Illinois have "single-handedly" achieved 64 percent of statewide carbon emission reductions called for in the federal Clean Power Plan, Gaier said. Dismantling that plan by the new administration has been decried by environmentalists. Lawlor said local officials can take actions that have a larger impact, such as revitalizing the lakefront in Waukegan. That would be a boost to the city and the region, but it won't happen with an operating power plant, Lawlor said. "We might as well have an orderly process of what the facility becomes," he said. "The sooner the better on the power plant and the sooner the better on its closure." Gaier said coal-powered plants will be phased out eventually, and he noted the company retired one of the two coal units at its Romeoville plant and converted the Joliet plant to natural gas. However, there is a short-term need for "controlled" coal plants in the power generating system, he said. The company in April met with leaders of the Sierra Club and Clean Power Lake County and said the plant is economically viable and continues to supply affordable and reliable power to Illinois consumers, he said. Meanwhile, Lawlor and others urged fellow officials to take action to reduce the county's carbon footprint. "This pledge offers a window of opportunity for civic engagement," Guzman said.

Climate change the cause of Great Lakes record high water ... and earlier record lows

Fires rage across the American West. Hurricanes batter the East Coast. Rising seas inundate coastal cities. In many parts of the United States, the signs of climate change are hard to miss. But the Great Lakes region of the Midwest has been considered something of a climate haven, a place to seek refuge from the ravages or stresses of climate change. 
That reputation, however, could be figuratively and literally eroding. Researchers say climate change is indeed impacting the Great Lakes. It's eroding shorelines, altering ecosystems, and causing flooding and economic damage. But scientists hoping to communicate the effects of climate change on the lakes have to first confront a seemingly incongruous set of facts: While shoreline communities now gird themselves for flooding, lake levels were at historic lows as recently as 2013. "We're at the beginning of this period of rapid change," University of Michigan climate scientists Prof. Richard B. Rood says. "We're not going to stabilize on something." Rood and fellow University of Michigan Professor Andrew Gronewold are researching the link between the variation in lake levels and climate change. "If you want to understand why water levels are changing, you need to look at precipitation, evaporation, and runoff," Gronewold says. "And if you want to understand why precipitation, evaporation, and runoff are changing, you've got to have a good understanding of climate change on continental and global scales." Because of climate change, when global weather patterns that affect regional climate cause more precipitation, that precipitation is more severe. When those same patterns translate to drier weather, that weather causes greater evaporation from the Great Lakes. "The community of climate skeptics have picked up on what Drew and I have been saying and mocking us for it: ‘Well, first low lake levels were climate change, now high lake levels,'" Rood says. Recent rising water levels are having disastrous effects. In May, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo stood along the shore of Lake Ontario and, after lamenting that he'd rather be fishing, said that he was instead declaring a state of emergency. In 2017, high water had flooded shoreline communities and damaged 4,000 properties. "Prepare for a redux of the same situation," the governor told constituents. In the fall, all of the Great Lakes were between 12 and 30 inches above the long-term average. In Chicago, crews began erecting flood barriers along Lake Michigan in September. Near record water levels have almost completely submerged two of the sandy beaches that line the city's lakefront. Condo buildings and other properties that abut the water are shelling out for reinforcements of their own. For cities and towns on the Great Lakes, closing beaches could have big economic consequences. According to a 2013 report from the Great Lakes Commission, an interstate agency, tourism along the 63 miles of Lake Michigan shore in Illinois draws 20 million people annually and recreational activities contribute $3.2 billion to the economy. And climate change isn't just submerging beaches and affecting property owners; it's also impacting aquatic ecosystems. Fish populations are changing in numbers and moving geographically. Some fish like smallmouth bass, for instance, have migrated to warming waters. Some fish, like the lake whitefish, might see growth rates decline. That's according to a recent report on climate change and the Great Lakes by the nonprofit Environmental Law & Policy Center. Invasive species like sea lampreys, a North Atlantic fish that sucks the bodily fluids out of its prey, are growing larger and more deadly to the recreationally and commercially important fish they feed on. As rain and snow become more severe, sewage and farm runoff could increasingly be flowing into the lakes, causing bacteria levels to spike and feeding dangerous algae blooms. The Great Lakes collectively represent about one-fifth of the world's fresh surface water supply. About 10 percent of the U.S. population, 30 million people, lives around them. While climate change will be affecting them, in just what direction may well vary. "It's a lot harder on the Great Lakes to say, ‘Hey, climate change is going to lead to increased variability,'" Gronewold says. "What does that mean from a planning perspective? Does that mean that we should be planning for high water levels, low water levels, or both?" The answer, of course, is both. * This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 300 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

Project to see if native grasses can be a key to dealing with climate change

Restoring landscapes to their native state is a regular practice for the Lake County Forest Preserve District, but a pending project at Grant Woods in Ingleside has the added aspect of climate change as a key element. In late October or early November, more than 800 pounds of native grass seed will be sown over 180 acres of what had been rolling agricultural fields east of Route 59 and north of Monaville Road. Two thirds of the land will be sown with seed "sourced" farther south than normally would be the case to determine whether it will be a better choice for future restorations as climate change progresses. "We know that by 2050, our climate is predicted to be more like Oklahoma," said Pati Vitt, manager of restoration ecology for the forest preserve district and originator of the "Growing Through Change" project. 
"This is more what I consider a demonstration project to see how we are sourcing seeds," Vitt added. "Should we be sourcing farther south and if so, how much farther south?" Along with the grasses, sedges will be planted in wetland areas on the site. Flowering plants will follow in fall 2021. The area is one part of an ongoing restoration at Grant Woods, which covers 1,226 acres. The broader effort has been facilitated by donations of more than $1.1 million to the Preservation Foundation of the Lake County Forest Preserves by a couple with long, personal ties to the land but who wish to remain anonymous, according to Rebekah Snyder, executive director. Some of that money, along with a $216,000 grant from the national Wildlife Conservation Society Climate Adaptation Fund, will be used for the $350,000 farmland restoration. "It's not just putting native seed on this agricultural parcel," Snyder said. "What we wanted to do was take a climate change model and put it on top of that." Vitt, who came to the forest district nearly two years ago, had been curator of the seed bank collection at the Chicago Botanic Garden. She's been considering the effects of climate change on native plant populations and seeds being used for 15 years or more. The restoration community long has grappled with this complex issue, and the Grant Woods project presents an opportunity to compare a new strategy with standard practice to determine what might work best going forward, according to Vitt. "This is a highly different approach," she said. "The concern might be if we don't keep up with that quickly changing climate, we could find in 20 years the plants in our natural areas aren't producing well enough." Because many species of pollinators respond to temperature, while plants respond to the length of the daylight, the two could get out of sync as the average temperature increases, according to Vitt. The district will monitor how the southern grasses survive, grow and reproduce, and whether their use will be more successful than standard strategies. "We can grow most anything but will it handle the new climate that's coming?" said Ken Klick, the forest district's site ecologist for Grant Woods. While climate models appear to be accurate in projecting what the changes will be, timing is less certain, Vitt said. That means the project runs the risk of sourcing too far south for current conditions. "We simply don't know," she said. "There have been few, if any, demonstration projects at this scale to explore this." Vitt says the research is needed to protect plant vitality and protect native ecosystems, and also provide fresh "marketplace opportunities" for retailers and consumers. It also could become a key seed source for other entities in the future, Klick noted. "This may be one of the most valuable restorations in the region 50 years from now," he said.

Money men tally cost of climate change

NEW YORK — Climate change is likely to exact enormous costs on U.S. regional economies in the form of lost property, reduced industrial output and more deaths, according to a report backed by a trio of men with vast business experience.
The report is designed to convince businesses to factor in the cost of climate change in their long-term decisions and to push for reductions in emissions blamed for heating the planet.
It was commissioned by the Risky Business Project, which describes itself as nonpartisan and is chaired by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Thomas F. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager.
"If we act immediately, we can still avoid most of the worst impacts of climate change and significantly reduce the odds of catastrophic outcomes," Paulson said.
Among the predictions: Between $66 billion and $106 billion in coastal property will likely be below sea level by 2050, labor productivity of outdoor workers could be reduced by 3 percent because extremely hot days will be far more frequent, and demand for electricity to power air conditioners will require the construction of more power plants that will cost electricity customers up to $12 billion per year.
"Every year that goes by without a comprehensive public and private sector response to climate change is a year that locks in future climate events that will have a far more devastating effect on our local, regional, and national economies," warn the report's authors.
The analysis and calculations in the report were performed by the Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, and Risk Management Solutions, a catastrophe-modeling company that works for insurance companies and other businesses. It was paid for by the philanthropic foundations of Bloomberg, Paulson and Steyer, among others.
The report analyzes the impacts of climate change by region to better show how climate change affects the businesses and industries that drive each region's economy.
* The Northeast will likely be most affected by sea level rise, which will cost an additional $6 billion to $9 billion in property loss each year.
* The Southeast will likely be affected both by sea-level rise and extreme temperatures. The region, which has averaged eight days of temperatures over 95 degrees each year, will likely see an additional 17 to 52 of these days by midcentury and up to four months of them by the end of the century. This could lead to 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths per year.
* Higher temperatures will reduce Midwest crop yields by 19 percent by midcentury and by 63 percent by the end of the century.
* The Southwest will see an extra month of temperatures above 95 degrees by 2050, which will lead to more frequent droughts and wildfires.
The report does not calculate the cost of these droughts or wildfires, or many other possible costs such as the loss of unique ecosystems and species and the possible compounding effects of extreme weather conditions. Nor does it calculate some of the ways economies could adapt to the changing climate and reduce the costs of climate change.
"There's a whole litany of things not calculated in the assessment," said Gary Yohe, an economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University and vice chair of the National Climate Assessment, a U.S. government project set up to study the effects of climate change. Yohe was not part of the Risky Business Project report, but he was asked to review it.
Still, he said, "The general conclusions are right on the money."
He also said that while other groups have also attempted to calculate the financial impacts of climate change around the world, this report is notable because of the business and financial experience of the people behind it. Beyond the three co-chairs, the members of the group's risk committee include Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, former Cargill CEO Gregory Page, and George Shultz, former treasury secretary and secretary of state.
"These are people who have managed risk all their lives and have made an enormous amount of money doing so," Yohe said.

Longer heat waves. Rising sea levels. Stronger hurricanes. More intense droughts. An ice-free summer in the Arctic Ocean by 2050.
That's what future generations can expect as the effects of global warming, accelerated by heat-trapping gases like methane and carbon dioxide, continue to alter weather patterns around the world.
James Hansen, a leading climate change researcher, and Tom Skilling, WGN-TV's chief meteorologist, will take an in-depth look at this phenomenon and discuss potential efforts to reduce its impact when they visit Benedictine University at 7 p.m. Thursday, April 21, in the Goodwin Hall Auditorium on campus, 5700 College Road, Lisle.
Hansen will present "Energy and Climate Change: How Can Justice be Achieved for Young People?" Skilling will serve as the event's moderator and emcee. The event is free, but seating is limited.
Hansen is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Earth Institute, where he directs the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions program, and is a former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
He is widely known for his work and testimony to Congress on climate change in the 1980s that helped raise awareness of global warming.
A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Hansen has received numerous awards, including the Sophie
and Blue Planet prizes, and is recognized for outlining actions needed to protect the future of young people and all species on the planet.
Skilling is a nationally recognized meteorologist who has been called "a weatherman's weather forecaster," and has more than 30 years of experience at WGN-TV in Chicago.
He is known for his in-depth reports, enthusiasm and use of state-of-the-art technology, and has written about the need for meteorologists to acknowledge and educate the public about the threat of climate change.
In addition to his television, radio and print work, Skilling has created many weather specials and documentaries. He received the Award for Outstanding Service by a Broadcast Meteorologist from the American Meteorological Society in 1997.
Skilling and Hansen were invited to speak at Benedictine by the university's nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Civic Leadership, which seeks to bring dynamic speakers to campus so that students and the larger community can immerse themselves in multiple issues and topics of public concern.

Climate change keeps changing the game for home gardeners

Every year now, gardeners should be rethinking what they grow and where because of climate change, experts say. The growing season has become longer, delivering bigger harvests but requiring more weeding and controls. Plants are under stress because of rising temperatures, less frequent but more intense precipitation, and changed pest and disease problems. Flowers and the insects that pollinate them are falling out of sync. 
"Conditions have become more challenging for gardeners since the weather has become more unpredictable," says Richie Steffen, executive director and curator of the Elizabeth Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. "We've had much hotter summers, while our winters have been all over the place," he says. "Some were dry. Some were very wet. And in this region at least, our wet spells tend to come with much heavier rains rather than our typical misty rains." The average home gardener should examine water use, and estimate how much of that precious resource is going to be necessary and available in the future, he says. "Be less rigid about lawns and not so fastidious about keeping them watered all summer," Steffen says. "Create more habitat and extend the flowering season for pollinators. "And be more selective about plant selection. Many things not so readily available 20 or 30 years ago are available now." The most trustworthy plants are those that regenerate quickly and can handle extremes, says Jessi Bloom, owner of NW Bloom EcoLogical Services in Redmond, Washington. "Another group of plants to consider is edibles, for personal resiliency and food security," she says. The climate in 2025 will be different even from that in 2020, so take that into account when doing your landscape planning, says Sara Tangren, invasive species foreman for Empire Landscape in Silver Springs, Maryland. "For perennials, stick with locally native plants. But when it comes to trees, look to a broader range," Tangren says. ‘'I'm not recommending natives when talking trees. Go for something instead that can take the heat." You also can expect more dormancy in lawns, she says. "They'll be going brown in summer, but you can transform that look in part and save on mowing by deciding which portions of the yard you really use," Tangren says. "Start planting perennials, shrubs and trees there instead." Precipitation is becoming more intense but less frequent, and temperatures are getting hotter, she notes. "Two inches of rain used to be a big deal around here, but now we're seeing 7 inches. That sounds like plenty, but when it falls in one day and the average temperature is 5 to 10 degrees higher, then the evaporation rate is higher and you don't have any access to it," Tangren says. "Soils don't store water as readily when they get too much at a time." Many things are blooming earlier than ever before and also lasting longer into the fall. "That's giving us more production but also more work," she says. Trees are leafing out faster, while the window for wildflower blooms is getting slower and they're being shaded out. "That means they won't be there for the insect pollinators and the songbirds, and this reverberates through the whole system,'' Tangren says.

Obama: Climate change already damaging parks

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — President Barack Obama said Saturday that climate change is already damaging America's national parks, with rising temperatures causing Yosemite's meadows to dry out and raising the prospect of a glacier preserve without its glaciers someday.
"Make no mistake. Climate change is no longer just a threat. It's already a reality," Obama said from a podium, with Yosemite Falls, one of the world's tallest at 2,425 feet, as a backdrop.
At the California park, where Obama was spending the weekend with his wife, Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha, the president also talked about how a rabbit-like animal known as a pika is being forced further upslope at Yosemite to escape the heat.
"Rising temperatures could mean no more glaciers at Glacier National Park. No more Joshua trees at Joshua Tree National Park," he said, adding that a changing climate could destroy vital ecosystems in the Everglades and threaten such landmarks as Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.
Obama spoke near Yosemite's Sentinel Bridge, where views of Half Dome, a well-known rock formation in the park, and Yosemite Falls created a picturesque background behind him under a sunny, blue sky.
After a night with his family in a rented cabin in the popular park, Obama stuck to his usual routine by rising early Saturday and heading to a recreation center on the grounds for his daily gym workout.
Obama's weekend in the great outdoors was planned to encourage more people to appreciate and visit many of the nation's parks. The National Park Services manages more than 400 sites around the country and celebrates its centennial in August.

Parking deck repairs: Naperville will begin maintenance work next week on the Van Buren Parking Deck at 43 W. Van Buren St. as part of its downtown parking deck maintenance program. Work will take place in three phases and is expected to take six weeks. The city has contracted with F.H. Paschen to repair the deck joints and replace the sealants on the fourth level of the deck. Additional work will include maintenance to the rooftop stairway/elevator vestibules and fifth-floor door and window frames to prevent water from leaking through to the lower decks, which contributes to deterioration of the structure. Crews will work from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. Portions of the third and fourth floor will be inaccessible during the first two phases. The fourth floor will be completely closed and inaccessible during the third phase, which is expected to begin Aug. 12. Unless otherwise noted, all levels of the parking deck will be re-opened and available for use on Saturdays and Sundays. Visit naperville.il.us/downtownparking. DuPage Woodworkers: DuPage Woodworkers will hold its annual auction on Saturday, July 20, at St. James the Apostle Church, 480 S. Park Blvd., Glen Ellyn. Registration begins at 8 a.m. with the auction starting promptly at 9 a.m. It generally features a selection of hand tools, power tools and supplies. Bring items related to woodworking (used tools you no longer want, a piece of maple that didn't fit into your last project, etc.) or just come to bid. It is suggested that small items be bundled as one lot. This year, they will sell six items for each seller and then move to the next seller. Sellers will be able to prioritize the order of sale. There will be one or two more rounds after the first one so you can bring more than six items to sell. Sellers must be a member of a woodworking club.

Longer heat waves. Rising sea levels. Stronger hurricanes. More intense droughts. An ice-free summer in the Arctic Ocean by 2050.
That's what future generations can expect as the effects of global warming, accelerated by heat-trapping gasses like methane and carbon dioxide, continue to alter weather patterns around the world.
James Hansen, Ph.D., a leading climate change researcher and Tom Skilling, WGN-TV's chief meteorologist, will take an in-depth look at this phenomenon and discuss potential efforts to reduce its impact when they visit Benedictine University on Thursday, April 21.
Hansen will present "Energy and Climate Change: How Can Justice be Achieved for Young People?" at 7:00 p.m. in the Goodwin Hall Auditorium. Skilling will serve as the event's moderator and emcee. The event is free and open to the public, however seating is limited.
Hansen is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's Earth Institute where he directs the Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions program and is a former director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He is widely known for his work and testimony to Congress on climate change in the 1980s that helped raise awareness of global warming.
A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Hansen has received numerous awards including the Sophie and Blue Planet prizes and is recognized for outlining actions needed to protect the future of young people and all species on the planet.
Skilling is a nationally recognized meteorologist who has been called "a weatherman's weatherman" and has more than 30 years of experience at WGN-TV in Chicago. He is known for his in-depth reports, enthusiasm and use of state-of-the-art technology, and has written about the need for meteorologists to acknowledge and educate the public about the threat of climate change.
In addition to his TV, radio and print work, Skilling has created many weather specials and informative documentaries. He received the Award for Outstanding Service by a Broadcast Meteorologist from the American Meteorological Society in 1997.
Skilling and Hansen were invited to speak at Benedictine by the University's nonpartisan, nonprofit Center for Civic Leadership (CCL), which seeks to bring dynamic speakers to campus so that students and the larger community can immerse themselves in multiple issues and topics of public concern.

TODAY'S EXECUTIVE ORDER Rewriting climate policies Order: Climate change will no longer have to figure into decisions

Former President Barack Obama tried to integrate climate change into every facet of federal decision-making; President Donald Trump aims to undo much of that work.
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that the executive order the president will sign today "will address the past administration's effort to kill jobs throughout the country through the Clean Power Plan," a reference to a regulation limiting greenhouse gases emitted by electric utilities. But it does much more than that.
What's in it:
* Instructions to the EPA to rewrite regulations restricting carbon emissions from both new and existing power plants. These two rules — particularly the one affecting existing plants, many of which are coal-fired — lie at the center of Obama's effort to curb the nation's carbon output. The limits on existing facilities aim to cut carbon pollution by about one-third by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and the rule subject to a pending lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The order would instruct Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ask the D.C. Circuit to hold the lawsuit in abeyance while EPA revises the rules, a process that will take more than a year and will inevitably face a court challenge.
* Lift a moratorium on federal coal leasing. Trump will direct the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management to lift the freeze on coal leasing on its land, which has been in effect since December 2015. In January, Interior proposed that the program guiding
coal exploration and production across 570 million publicly owned acres be updated to factor in the climate effect of such activities and provide a bigger return for U.S. taxpayers.
This will not have a major impact on domestic coal production, since the government has sold one set of coal leases since October 2012 and has estimated that it has already granted leases that are equivalent to a 20-year supply of coal.
But Pruitt told ABC that this and other policies in the order constitute "a promise to the American people — saying we can put people back to work and be pro-environment as well."
* Abolish federal guidance instructing agencies to incorporate climate change into federal decision-making. Obama ordered agencies to include climate change as a consideration when they conducted reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, a sweeping law that informed any federal decision that had a significant environmental impact. This will be eliminated outright.
* Jettison the Obama's administration's "social cost of carbon." The order would dissolve the task force that calculated what has become known as "the social cost of carbon" and revert to the 2003 standard used under the George W. Bush administration.
The current calculus, which is set at $36 per ton of carbon dioxide, aims to capture the negative consequences of allowing greenhouse gas emissions to continue to rise and is applied to any regulations that have a climate impact.
* Promote oil and gas development on Interior's lands, including national wildlife refuges.
The order would make it easier to flare methane on oil and gas operations on federal land-in November the previous administration issued a rule curbing such "fugitive" emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, which the House has voted to overturn. It would also make it easier to conduct energy exploration on land managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
What's not in it:
* Language on the Paris climate agreement. The president's top advisers have been divided over whether the United States should formally withdraw from the 2015 global warming pact that Obama and his deputies helped broker through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
Under that accord, which has already entered into force, the United States voluntarily committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels in 2025, while making "best efforts" to reduce those emissions by 28 percent.
In his Sunday interview, Pruitt suggested that whether the United States opts out or remains in the agreement is unrelated to Tuesday's executive action.
"The Paris accord is nonbinding. It was not a treaty, as such. The Clean Power Plan is not tethered to the Paris accords," he said. "This is an effort to undo the unlawful approach the previous administration engaged in and do it right going forward with the mind set of being pro-growth and pro-environment."

Republicans playing the long game on term limits Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows Recount: Kirk's statement about climate change raises eyebrows

A key effort of the Rauner campaign has re-emerged in the Legislature, but the suburban lawmaker behind it says he's playing the long game.
State Rep. Ron Sandack, a Downers Grove Republican, has proposed an amendment to the Illinois Constitution calling for 10-year term limits for state lawmakers.
Rauner tried to get a similar measure put before voters on the November ballot, but it was tossed in court. Still, it remained a major talking point for a campaign running against the Springfield establishment.
Sandack says he knows that establishment — Democrats who control the House and Senate — won't let his plan go anywhere.
Plus, opponents of term limits say cutting off experienced lawmakers puts government in the hands of people who aren't term-limited and can profit from their knowledge — like lobbyists.
Sandack says he didn't introduce it in conjunction with Rauner but hopes keeping the issue alive could help drive public support for another push in 2016.
"The folks in charge of the
General Assembly are still in charge," Sandack said.
Mappin'
For a term-limits plan to succeed in Illinois, backers might need more help with legal support than voter support because the courts tripped it up.
Sandack is also behind a similarly fated plan to change the way state political boundaries are drawn. Democrats redrew the legislative and congressional maps on their own in 2010 and stand to reap the benefits until the next census.
The idea to change the process also got booted off the ballots by courts last year, and moving it through the Legislature would be asking the people who drew the maps to change the game. Again, quite unlikely.
Elimination game
Republican state Rep. David McSweeney of Barrington Hills won House approval of his amendment eliminating the lieutenant governor's office in 2013. But it was never approved by the Senate and died.
He's trying again this year. Will things be different with Republican Evelyn Sanguinetti of Wheaton sitting in the No. 2 spot?
It wouldn't take effect until after the 2018 election if voters approved it in 2016. And Republicans are backing the plan to merge the state's comptroller and treasurer offices, too.
Climate question
In an interview this week, U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, a Highland Park Republican, said he'd like President Barack Obama to back his plan to ban sewage dumping in the Great Lakes.
It was an opportunity to ask Kirk about climate change, given that lately some environmental activists have criticized Kirk for a comment he made to trade publication E&E Daily.
Here's how the publication quoted him: "We had the previous warming period, which was called the global optimum, and the best way to talk about that is when Leif Erickson went west from his home, he discovered a landmass that he called Greenland, because it was. And that was called the global optimum, because the planet was much warmer. By calling Greenland ‘green land,' we know that the climate has been changing pretty regularly within recorded memory."
Kirk's office originally responded with this statement: "Climate change is real and human beings definitely play a role. As I have said since 2010, I will not support a carbon tax or similar attempts which hurt the Illinois or American economy."
This week, before the State of the Union address, Kirk said he didn't want to get into a climate change discussion.
"I would say that my top environmental goal is to back this sewage dumping ban in the Great Lakes," he said.
"I would like people to sit back in another generation and marvel at how pristine the Great Lakes are," he said.

Demonstrators demand that Roskam address climate change
Chicago Daily Herald

More than 200 people rallied Monday in West Chicago to call on U.S. Rep. Peter Roskam to take action on climate change and support clean energy.
The demonstrators, some of them holding signs with slogans such as "Follow the science" and "Clean energy creates jobs," gathered in a large meeting room down the hall from Roskam's district office at the DuPage Airport before dropping off postcards for the congressman.
"We want to let him know that we think we need to do something about climate change," said Tim Milburn of the Sierra Club Northwest Cook County Group.
Milburn said local Sierra Club chapters organized Monday's rally because they're concerned that President Donald Trump's administration may reverse the progress that's been made on climate change mitigation and clean energy.
Organizers decided to reach out to Roskam because "he's not exactly a climate change proponent," Milburn said. He added that Roskam has "a bad record when it comes to dealing with this environmental issue."
J.C. Kibbey said during the rally that 97 percent of scientists agree that climate change is real.
"Climate change is happening and it is caused by humans," said Kibbey, Midwest outreach and policy advocate for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "There is no continuing debate in the scientific community. And there is no question that the science is conclusive."
To fix the problem, "we need to move to a clean energy economy as soon as possible," he said.
Jack Darin, director of the Sierra Club's Illinois chapter, said everyone who attended the rally is "part of the majority" of residents in Roskam's 6th Congressional District "who want to keep moving forward." The district includes parts of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake and McHenry counties.
"We want to listen to the scientists and act on climate change," Darin said. "Move beyond dirty fuels to clean energy for all the benefits that it offers to all the citizens of the 6th District, our country and our planet."
While there's a new president, Darin said, people in the 6th District didn't vote to stop creating jobs in solar and wind and energy conservation.
"They didn't vote to opt out of the global effort to stand up and solve climate change," he said.
Therefore, Roskam and other members of Congress should support efforts "to make sure the worst of President Trump's promises will never come true," Darin said.
Roskam wasn't at his district office Monday. According to a spokesman, he was in Washington D.C.
The spokesman issued a statement saying that Roskam supports an "all-of-the-above approach when it comes to energy."
"American ingenuity has made it possible to rid ourselves of our dependence on foreign oil and eliminate a major national security threat," the statement reads. "Each year, new advancements in technology and research allow us to better provide for our energy and security needs while safeguarding our natural resources for the future."

Illinois economists: Protect climate with price on carbon

Climate change is considered to be the greatest challenge of our generation and for good reason. As global average temperatures have increased 1°C (1.8° F) over the last 100 years, storms have become stronger and more damaging, flooding and drought are both more common and more intense and loss from wildfires has grown dramatically. The cost of destructive weather is rising dramatically. According to NOAA, climate and weather-related disasters now regularly cost the U.S. over $100 billion a year, a more than fivefold increase from just the 1980s on an inflation-adjusted basis. 
Illinois is not immune from a changing climate. The EPA's assessment for Illinois predicts that climate change will lead to more intense precipitation and flooding events in the spring and more intense heat and drought in the summer. These changes will lead to higher incidence of flooded farmland. Our area experienced 500-year floods in 2011, 2017 and 2019. We will also face challenges to management of water resources, increased heat-related deaths and ecosystem stresses in Lake Michigan. If current global climate policies to reduce emissions are not strengthened, this 1.8° F temperature increase will at least triple by the end of this century and corresponding damages will increase even more. As the IMF recently stated, "Without further action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the planet is on course to reach temperatures not seen in millions of years, with potentially catastrophic implications." This cannot be our future or the future we leave to our children. But a simple, effective solution, one that is broadly favored by economists, can stabilize climate risk, increase job opportunities, improve public health and provide a financial benefit to the most vulnerable in our society. The solution is explained in the "largest public statement of economists in history," signed by all living Chairs of the Federal Reserve, 28 Nobel Laureates and over 3500 other economists. It is to simply put a fee on carbon pollution and then return all funds raised directly to households in the form of "carbon dividends." This solution, commonly referred to as "carbon fee and dividend," is favored by economists because it "offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary," the public statement says. By creating a financial incentive for all consumers and producers to reduce carbon emissions, it will send a powerful price signal that steers economic actors toward a low-carbon future. Because this policy does not ban any particular activities or mandate any particular mitigation behavior, it allows consumers and producers the freedom and flexibility to reduce emissions in the way that is best for them. Reductions are achieved at least cost to the economy. In fact, the IMF report cited earlier shows that a strong carbon fee and dividend policy will lead to a small increase in GDP in the near-term and improve it dramatically in future decades as tremendous climate-related damages are avoided. Further, it states that this type of market-based policy will have a "net positive effect" on employment. And as carbon and other pollutants are reduced, the policy greatly improves our health and saves tens of thousands of lives each year. Finally, this approach provides a direct monetary payment to all Americans, including the poorest among us. Simply by charging a fee for pollution and returning all funds to the American people, "The majority of American families, including the most vulnerable, will benefit financially by receiving more in ‘carbon dividends' than they pay in increased energy prices," the economists wrote. We agree: a carbon fee and dividend policy is a clear win-win for America. We can stabilize climate risk, improve the economy, increase job opportunities in the industries of the future, improve our health and help the most vulnerable, all with one policy. The time to tackle climate change is now and carbon fee and dividend should be the centerpiece. * Christopher Clapp, Ph.D., teaches economics in the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. Jerry Hinkle, M.A., is the economic research coordinator for Citizens' Climate Lobby and serves on CCL's governing board. This statement has been signed by 21 economists around the state of Illinois.

It's easy for Illinois residents to take Lake Michigan for granted. Only a sliver of the state fronts it, unlike Michigan and Wisconsin. Many residents might have only seen it on the occasional trip to Chicago. Even suburban residents go years, if not decades, without dipping a toe in it. 
But changes in the climate change Lake Michigan. How much should you worry about that? If you have lakeshore property, maybe a lot. Climate change seems to be leading to more dramatic swings in the lake's water-height cycle, according to Jennifer Caddick, vice president of communications and engagement for the Alliance for the Great Lakes, a nonprofit group devoted to protecting the Great Lakes. If you live inland and are among the millions who drink, cook and water lawns with Lake Michigan water, maybe a little. Some forms of pollution are increasing, but Lake Michigan's depth helps protect against toxic algal blooms that have created dead zones or sent illness-causing bacteria into water supplies in other parts of the Great Lakes. 90% of U.S. fresh water Lake Michigan is one of the five Great Lakes — the world's largest system of freshwater resources. The lakes — nicknamed the "Sweetwater Seas" — account for 19 percent of the world's fresh water and 90 percent of the fresh water in the United States. Lake Michigan is the second-largest in volume, after Lake Superior. It is 307 miles long, 118 miles wide, and reaches a maximum depth of about 925 feet. Breezes that pass over the lake in the summer are noted for cooling off downtown Chicago. Snowstorms passing over open portions in winter pick up moisture, hitting northwest Indiana hard with lake-effect snow. The Illinois International Port District advertises the Port of Chicago as "America's Fourth Coast," handling 19 million tons of cargo a year. Navy Pier says that more than 9 million people visited the entertainment attraction in 2016. We're justly proud of the efforts of architect Daniel Burnham and others, who persuaded politicians to put parks along much of the Chicago shoreline, rather than factories and docks. Infrastructure threatened Lake levels have gone through cycles before, according to historical records. But scientists believe increasing warmth in the atmosphere in North America is leading to more compressed cycles, with higher highs and lower lows. High water levels eat away at beaches, retaining walls and other areas along the shoreline. The Chicago Park District has lost a North Side beach and sustained significant damage to two others and is beginning aerial mapping to study beach erosion. "Those cycles are starting to change in unpredictable ways," Caddick said. When air temperatures are warmer, water temperature increases (and ice coverage decreases). Warm water evaporates more, especially in cooler air in the fall and early winter, according to a report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center. A more-saturated atmosphere leads to heavier, more violent storms. Warmer water helps harmful algae, and some invasive species such as quogga mussels, to thrive. Increased precipitation, particularly heavier events, are increasing pollution flowing into the lake, over the ground and via sanitary-sewage releases, according to Caddick. Some current sewage-treatment systems, especially combined stormwater-sanitary-sewage systems, can't handle the volume of more frequent, heavier storms, she said. To avoid having sewage back up in buildings, they open the gates at treatment plants and release untreated sewage into the lake, or into rivers that lead to the lake. "That's not good to have that extra pollution flowing into our rivers and lakes," Caddick said. Drinking water What about our drinking water? The Metropolitan Planning Council estimates that 6.6 million people in northern Illinois rely on Lake Michigan for drinking water. A 1967 Supreme Court decision enables Illinois to divert up to 2 billion gallons per day, through water plants, the Chicago River and several sewage and shipping canals. Much of the potable water flows through two city of Chicago plants, including 1 billion through the James W. Jardine Water Purification Plant, which is touted as the world's largest. Chicago's plants don't just serve the city; water from them is served up to residents of many Cook suburbs, and nearly all towns in DuPage County. One of the other treatment plants belongs to the Central Lake County Joint Action Water Agency, in Lake Bluff. The plant's interim director, Bill Soucie, doesn't expect climate change to significantly affect the agency's ability to deliver water. "It (the lake) just doesn't change that quickly," Soucie said. His agency draws an average of 19 million gallons a day. The intake devices are located 3,000 feet out from shore, and about 26 feet below the surface. Even if climate change puts more water in the Lake Michigan basin, that's an advantage to his agency; the more water on top of the intakes, the faster it flows to the treatment plant, he said. Soucie said his agency hasn't experienced the troubles other areas throughout the Great Lakes have seen, such as toxic algal blooms. Harmful bacteria from a bloom forced the City of Toledo to turn off drinking water for three days in 2014. The blooms are caused largely by nutrient-laden fertilizer runoff, but warmer water temperatures help them grow, according to Caddick. The Chicago area might be less likely to face that problem, she said, due to much less fertilizer runoff and increased depth. Indirect effect? What if people further inland, running out of water in their aquifers, want to get Lake Michigan water? The 2008 Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin Water Resources Compact would prevent that. The compact, between the eight Great Lakes states, says that only areas that are in the Great Lakes basin can use its water. (The ability of Illinois plants to send Lake Michigan water to communities outside the basin is governed by the earlier court order.) Only parts of Cook and Lake counties are in the basin. But if a lot of people moved here as climate refugees from areas having significant environmental changes, there could be issues. Illinois uses an average of 76 percent of its allocation, according to the Metropolitan Planning Council. And the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning estimated in 2012 that 22 billion gallons of that was wasted — leaking out of pipes before it ever got to users. Replacing our crumbling public infrastructure would help, but the report notes a lack of willingness or ability to spend the money necessary to do so.

Climate change keeps changing the game for gardeners

Every year now, gardeners should be rethinking what they grow and where because of climate change, experts say. The growing season has become longer, delivering bigger harvests but requiring more weeding and controls. Plants are under stress because of rising temperatures, less frequent but more intense precipitation, and changed pest and disease problems. 
Flowers and the insects that pollinate them are falling out of sync. "Conditions have become more challenging for gardeners since the weather has become more unpredictable," says Richie Steffen, executive director and curator of the Elizabeth Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. "We've had much hotter summers, while our winters have been all over the place," he says. "Some were dry. Some were very wet. And in this region at least, our wet spells tend to come with much heavier rains rather than our typical misty rains." The average home gardener should examine water use, and estimate how much of that precious resource is going to be necessary and available in the future, he says. "Be less rigid about lawns and not so fastidious about keeping them watered all summer," Steffen says. "Create more habitat and extend the flowering season for pollinators. "And be more selective about plant selection. Many things not so readily available 20 or 30 years ago are available now." The most trustworthy plants are those that regenerate quickly and can handle extremes, says Jessi Bloom, owner of NW Bloom EcoLogical Services in Redmond, Washington. "Another group of plants to consider is edibles, for personal resiliency and food security," she says. The climate in 2025 will be different even from that in 2020, so take that into account when doing your landscape planning, says Sara Tangren, invasive species foreman for Empire Landscape in Silver Springs, Maryland. "For perennials, stick with locally native plants. But when it comes to trees, look to a broader range," Tangren says. ‘'I'm not recommending natives when talking trees. Go for something instead that can take the heat." You also can expect more dormancy in lawns, she says. "They'll be going brown in summer, but you can transform that look in part and save on mowing by deciding which portions of the yard you really use," Tangren says. "Start planting perennials, shrubs and trees there instead." Precipitation is becoming more intense but less frequent, and temperatures are getting hotter, she notes. "Two inches of rain used to be a big deal around here, but now we're seeing 7 inches. That sounds like plenty, but when it falls in one day and the average temperature is 5 to 10 degrees higher, then the evaporation rate is higher and you don't have any access to it," Tangren says. "Soils don't store water as readily when they get too much at a time." Many things are blooming earlier than ever before and also lasting longer into the fall. "That's giving us more production but also more work," she says. Trees are leafing out faster, while the window for wildflower blooms is getting slower and they're being shaded out. "That means they won't be there for the insect pollinators and the songbirds, and this reverberates through the whole system,'' Tangren says.

GENEVA — In the wake of heat waves, global warming, forest fires, storms, droughts and a rising number of hurricanes, the U.N. weather agency warned Tuesday that the number of people who need international humanitarian help could rise 50% by 2030 compared to the 108 million who needed it worldwide in 2018. In a new report released with partners, the World Meteorological Agency says more disasters attributed to weather are taking place each year. It said over 11,000 disasters have been attributed to weather, climate and phenomena like tsunamis that are related to water over the last 50 years — causing 2 million deaths and racking up $3.6 trillion worth of economic costs. In one hopeful development over that period, the average number of deaths from each separate weather disaster per year has dropped by one-third, even as the number of such events and the economic costs from them have both surged. 
The 2020 State of Climate Services report, compiled by 16 international agencies and financing institutions, calls on governments to put more money into early-warning systems that can improve countries' ability to prepare for, respond to and mitigate the impact of such natural disasters. "While COVID-19 generated a large international health and economic crisis from which it will take years to recover, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat to human lives, ecosystems, economies and societies for centuries to come," said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. "Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to move forward along a more sustainable path towards resilience and adaptation in the light of anthropogenic climate change," he said. Taalas, responding to a question from China's CCTV network at a news conference, also hailed a "great" announcement from Chinese President Xi Jinping last month that his country plans to become carbon-neutral by 2060. Taalas noted investments in renewable energy programs like solar and wind in China, the source of one-fourth of global carbon emissions — largely due to coal-fired power plants. While praising the U.S. private sector for its efforts to fight climate change, Taalas also expressed hope the U.S. government — which under the Trump administration has rejected the 2015 Paris climate accord — to come on board. He noted the "common vision" between China and many European Union countries on the issue. The European bloc wants to become carbon-neutral by 2050, though not all member states agree on how to achieve that target. "I hope that also the USA will join that club in the near future," he said.

UN chief: Governments must ‘act faster' on climate change UN Secretary General António Guterres says governments around the world are not responding fast enough to address problems of a changing climate. But in an interview with Covering Climate Now, a worldwide consortium of news outlets focusing coverage on climate change this week, he says he sees encouraging signs that citizens are beginning to put the kind of pressure on their leaders that is needed "to make governments understand that they need to run faster." The interviewers included Mark Herstgaard of Climate Change Now, CBS's Mark Phillips, and Amanda Mars, of El País. To see the interview in English, click here.

State House candidates differ on proposed graduated tax Graduated: Candidates also address pensions, climate change Graduated: House candidates also address pensions, climate change

The candidates vying for the 51st House District seat differ on the graduated income tax amendment, although both oppose any tax on retirement benefits. Incumbent Mary Edly-Allen, a Libertyville Democrat, is facing Chris Bos, a Lake Zurich Republican, in Tuesday's election. The district includes all or portions of the Barrington area, Lake Zurich, Long Grove, Libertyville and Mundelein. The ballot also includes a referendum on a constitutional amendment allowing for a graduated income tax to replace the state's flat tax. 
Gov. J.B. Pritzker's administration calls it the "Fair Tax," saying 97% of taxpayers — those who make under $250,000 per year — would pay the same or less in income taxes under its plan, while wealthier taxpayers would pay more. Edly-Allen supports the graduated tax, which should be coupled with a reduction in spending to protect middle class taxpayers from future tax hikes, she said. "We all want good roads, we all want good bridges, we all want good schools ... we all want all these great services, but who's paying going to pay for them?" she said. Bos said the graduated tax will be detrimental to local businesses and a deterrent to entrepreneurship, with no guarantees against future tax increases on middle- and lower-income residents. "Springfield's proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted," he said. Both candidates said they support legislative ethics reform, including term limits for legislative leaders. Lawmakers should be prohibited from becoming lobbyists after they leave office, both said — for at least one year, Edly-Allen said, or at least two years, Bos said. To help solve the state's pension problem, Bos said, the legislature needs to pass a state constitutional amendment to allow comprehensive reform, and lawmakers should not take their General Assembly pensions. Edly-Allen said the pension problem must be tackled in a bipartisan manner with input from all stakeholders. She's in favor of keeping pension promises, but it's imperative to figure out what can be done moving forward, she said. As for climate change, Bos said humans have an impact on it, while Eldy-Allen said humans cause it. Bos said he supports clean energy technology. Edly-Allen said she supports investing in clean energy programs and jobs that reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Neither candidate expressed support for defunding police. Bos said police must have adequate resources and training, and must understand the needs and concerns of the communities served. The legislature can help provide better jobs in low-income communities and tax relief for property owners and small businesses, he said. Edly-Allen said local police should get more funding for community policing, body cameras and de-escalation training. Also, the state should invest more in programs that provide economic and educational opportunities in minority communities, she said. support legislative ethics reform, including term limits for legislative leaders.

Images: The impact of climate change Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, droughts, floods and pestilence are nothing new to Planet Earth or even to our comparatively brief human experience here. But, because of humankind's impact on the environment, are these phenomena growing more frequent and more intense? Nature, it has been said, does not need us; we need Nature. These photos show some of what may be in store if we don't get control of the activities that scientists say are changing our climate.

On Monday, April 22, the Environmental Defenders of McHenry County will present the documentary "Chasing Ice" at McHenry County College's Luecht Conference Center, 8900 Route 14, Crystal Lake.
An afternoon showing is planned for 1:30 p.m., and an evening at 7 p.m., with doors opening at 6:30 p.m. The screenings are free and open to the public; donations to help cover costs are accepted.
"Chasing Ice" follows acclaimed environmental photographer James Balog as he heads to the Arctic on assignment for National Geographic. His goal is to capture images that help tell the story of the Earth's changing climate.
A skeptic about global warming when his journey began, Balog discovers undeniable evidence of climate change. Using time-lapse cameras, his videos compress years into seconds and capture ancient mountains of ice in motion as they disappear at a breathtaking rate. The film provides a way to visualize climate change in progress.
An Academy Award nominee, "Chasing Ice" has received many awards since its release last November. This will be the first screening in McHenry County.
This event is sponsored by Environmental Defenders of McHenry County and MCC Down to Earth.
Glacier retreat is the most visible indicator of climate change in the world today. Glaciers are excellent gauges of climate because their retreat, growth, or stasis reflects regional temperature and precipitation patterns.
The vast majority of glaciers in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Oceania are retreating due to warming temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns, with the rate of ice loss accelerating in recent decades. Humanity is directly and immediately affected by glacier retreat through water resources, sea level, and ocean circulation. It also acts as an early warning of other climate change impacts now accelerating worldwide.
For more information, see "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," U.S. Global Change Research Program, at .
Donations are encouraged and are tax-deductible as charitable contributions. For more information, visit or call (815) 338-0393.

‘There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty. We've ruled out ‘fine.' ‘Fine' is not going to happen' There's a common adage among scientists and statisticians: "All models are wrong, but some are useful." That's certainly true in the modern world, where — despite the fact that they're by nature mere shadows of real-world scenarios — computer models serve as vital guideposts in some of humanity's most complex and dangerous pursuits, from skyscraper and bridge construction to air and space travel. In the world of climate science, models have come under particularly intense scrutiny, with some skeptics dismissing them entirely. 
At the same time, thousands of scientists are banking on these models as guideposts for the planet's future. What makes them so sure? "(Climate) models encapsulate everything we know about how the world works," says Andrew Gettelman, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. The equations that are their foundation are ones we use over and over, and are interwoven in the fabric of our lives. "If we didn't understand thermodynamics and we didn't understand water and how water condenses, internal combustion engines wouldn't work," he says. "If we didn't understand fluid dynamics, we couldn't predict the weather, we couldn't make pipe systems work, and make chemical plants work. None of the physics in climate models is new." That said, today's models are incredibly complex, taking into account a multitude of processes that affect climate, and uncertainty is part of their DNA. They offer a range of scenarios based on human actions — the choices we make around mitigating carbon emission, for instance — but there also is uncertainty in the forecasts each model gives, and a difference in what the top models being used tell us. Take the most basic: long-term global temperature increase. Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, notes that what the models predict ranges from warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 4.5 degrees Celsius — and that gap hasn't materially changed as models have gotten more sophisticated. "That's kind of bonkers," says Marvel. "A degree and a half is not that bad, and 4 1/2 degrees is totally catastrophic." But Marvel, and others, worry that communicating scientific uncertainty to the broader public can be misinterpreted: "There is uncertainty, but there is also really, really great certainty," she says. "We've ruled out ‘fine.' ‘Fine' is not going to happen." Scientists generally welcome uncertainty, says Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University. Differences among climate models help show the points where they agree, and the elements we can really trust, and the range of results they give help us understand the risks of various actions. "Uncertainty doesn't mean you should not take action because you don't know the outcome," says Shindell. "It means you should be very cautious about the extremes happening because you can't rule them out." Simulated worlds A lot of the confusion about models comes from a misunderstanding of what they are, and what they aim to do, says Gettelman. The models aren't theoretical worlds so much as simulated ones, constrained by laws of physics and chemistry and constantly being validated against observations, recent history, and the deep past. Climate models aren't designed to predict specific weather or events, but they do predict the probability of weather patterns and weather extremes occurring. Today's models require massive supercomputers to run them. The Community Earth System Model Gettelman works on relies on some 1.5 million lines of code. Most climate models break the Earth down into a 3-D grid system, calculating that system for grids at various longitudes and latitudes and heights into the atmosphere. As the models improve, those grids get ever finer and incorporate more elements of the climate system. These simulations have come a long way from the basic energy-balance model that Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist, used to demonstrate the greenhouse effect back in the 1890s. But in essence, they're not that different from the far more basic climate models that scientists were using four or five decades ago. "At their heart, (models) follow basic physical laws that are very well understood," says Shindell. "We have theory and we have observation and we have measurements in the real world that all hold together." Kicking the tires Rather than blindly trusting the models out there, climate scientists are constantly questioning them, says Katharine Hayhoe, co-director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. "The more you know about models, the less you trust them, and the more you kick their tires," Hayhoe says. She knows what they're good at, like simulating observed changes in temperature and the jet stream. And she knows what they do less well, such as modeling how quickly the ice sheets are melting or the rate that Arctic sea ice is lost. In those cases, as with extreme precipitation, many models actually are underestimating how fast things are changing, says Hayhoe. Models are also better at predicting changes over a bigger time and space scale than they are at forecasting those changes for smaller regions, or the nearer-term future. And, when it comes to the big differences among what the models tell us, scientists are getting better at understanding where that gap comes from. One of the major reasons: clouds. The clouded view Clouds have become a huge focus of many climate scientists because of the large impact they have on climate. But cloud formations are incredibly complicated to model reliably. Clouds have a warming effect, because they act like a blanket over the Earth. But they also have a cooling effect, as white clouds reflect solar energy away. The net effect of clouds on the planet tends to be cooling, explains Gettelman, and it's a huge effect. "Small changes to clouds can really magnify or damp what we do with carbon dioxide," he says. Given all that, clouds are one of the most important things for a climate model to get right, but also one of the hardest. The scale at which clouds form is tiny: liquid water droplets crystallizing around a dust grain. "That is incredibly small scale," Dr. Marvel says, "but of course climate models need to simulate the entire climate, which is the largest scale you can get, and those don't match very well together." To get around that, models approximate clouds in various ways, but it's an imperfect science, and much of modelers' efforts these days go into improving and refining those approximations. They're also starting to bring in other key parts of the climate system, like the biological processes involved in the carbon cycle — how natural land- and ocean-based carbon sinks may shift in the future. Building a virtual planet Despite all these uncertainties, scientists emphasize that the models are consistent on the most basic points: The Earth is warming. We'll get more days of extreme temperatures, with dangerous levels of heat. And there will be more extreme precipitation events. What's perhaps most disconcerting to many climate scientists is the fact that with the most recent generation of models, which have worked hard to incorporate more processes and reduce structural uncertainties, many have started running "hotter" — showing temperature changes in the long term of 5 or 6 degrees C instead of 4 degrees — and it's not yet clear why that is. These newer models might be more accurate, Marvel says, but without fully understanding why what they're telling us has changed, she doesn't think their results can be totally accepted. But what scientists emphasize over and over is that while the models they work with may not be perfect — and are almost certainly "wrong" at some level — they offer us the most complete, and validated, way we have of understanding our climate trajectory. In essence, the models are the laboratories that climate scientists use. Earth scientists can't build anything in the real world that replicates our entire system, so "in order to conduct experiments on our planet, we have to build a virtual planet," Hayhoe says. Climate models "are like alternative Earths that we can run what-if experiments on," she continues, "which further underscores the fact that we are currently running an unprecedented, although inadvertent, experiment with our actual planet, which is the only home that we have." * This story originally appeared in Christian Science Monitor and is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

Sierra Nevada a ‘living lab' for climate change

SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. — In parts of California's Sierra Nevada, marshy meadows are going dry, wildflowers are blooming earlier and glaciers are melting into ice fields.
Scientists also are predicting the optimal temperature zone for giant sequoias will rise hundreds and hundreds of feet, leaving trees at risk of dying over the next 100 years.
As indicators point toward a warming climate, scientists across 4 million acres of federally protected land are noting changes affecting everything from the massive trees that can grow to more than two-dozen feet across to the tiny, hamsterlike pika. But what the changes mean and whether humans should do anything to intervene are sources of disagreement among land managers.
"That's the tricky part of the debate: If humans are causing warming, does that obligate us under the laws of the National Park Service to try to counteract those effects?" said Nate Stephenson, a research ecologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
"How do you adapt to a changing climate if you're a national park?" added Stephenson, who is 30 years into a study of trees in the largest wilderness in the continental U.S., Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.
Since 1895, the average temperature across California has increased by 1.7 degrees, and experts say the most visible effects of that warming occur within the Sierra Nevada, where low temperatures are rising and precipitation increasingly falls as rain rather than snow. Some models show noncoastal California warming by 2.7 degrees between 2000 and 2050, one of many reasons President Obama pledged last week to use executive powers to cut carbon pollution.
The state's two largest rivers — the Sacramento and San Joaquin — originate in the Sierra. The range also is home to Lake Tahoe, the largest alpine lake in North America; Mount Whitney, the highest peak in the Lower 48; and the nation's only groves of giant sequoias, the largest living things on earth.
There are mounting concerns about the beloved sequoias, whose sprawling, 10-foot-deep root systems make them especially vulnerable to drought and heat.
Because the trees exist only in such a small region, scientists are debating whether to irrigate the 65 groves in the southern Sierra to help them endure warmer temperatures.
Otherwise they fear the trees could die. During the last warm, dry period 4,000 to 10,000 years ago, their numbers were greatly diminished, according to pollen evidence collected by researchers at Northern Arizona University.
"Whether we would water them certainly comes up on our climate change scenario planning," said Koren Nydick, science coordinator at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. "They are a very unusual species because they're also looked on as a social artifact."
Stephenson says his decades of studying conifers in Sequoia National Forest have shown they are dying at twice their historic rate, partly because the climate is warmer and dryer.
The giant sequoias grow much more slowly than conifers over many hundreds of years so changes have been tougher to recognize, though researchers suspect seedlings already may be having a harder time taking root.
"That's always the million-dollar question," said Stephenson, director of USGS's Sierra Nevada Global Change Research Program. "We just don't have a big enough sample size to know what's going on with the giant sequoias, whereas we monitor thousands of pines and firs and have much more confidence."
So far, the dozens of changes researchers have noted, in everything from earlier songbird fledging dates to greater wildfire intensity, may point to a warming climate. But it's far from understood whether that would mean doom or adaptation for California's ecological heart.
"I don't want to say that because we're seeing one thing, that's how it will play out," said Rob Klinger who is studying alpine mammals for the USGS's Western Ecological Research Center. "The endgame of our study is determining whether there will be uniform change or will it be patchwork. If you look at evolutionary time scales, species have gone through these changes before, and they handle it."
As part of a Ph.D. project at the University of California, Merced, Kaitlin Lubetkin for five summers has hiked the backcountry taking inventory of 350 subalpine meadows formed when glaciers retreated eons ago. The marshy ground acts as a reservoir that eases flooding after snow melts, and the stored water feeds streams during dry months and sustains wildlife such as the endangered willow flycatcher songbird and the Yosemite toad, which is being considered for threatened species status.
Over the past decade of warmer, drier conditions, however, pine trees have begun to take root, acting like straws to pull the moisture out of the meadows, Klinger and Lubetkin have observed.
"Pretty much right up to the tree line you're getting encroachment in every meadow," said Lubetkin.
In September, Hassan Basagic of the Glaciers of the American West Project will be hiking to 12,000 feet elevation to measure the Lyell Glacier in Yosemite National Park and monitor the changes he first began observing in the early 2000s. Scientists from Yosemite National Park and the University of Colorado recently noted that the glacier is no longer moving — and is melting — by using measurements they've made over the past four years, as well as some of Basagic's earlier work.
Basagic's used photos from the 1930s to show that in the early 2000s the rate at which the Sierra's glaciers were receding picked up.
"A lot of people call glaciers the `canary in the coal mine.' They're an indicator that the alpine climate is changing," said Basagic, who monitors glacial changes for Portland State University research projects. "With that change, other things will change, like the plants and animals that depend on certain climatic conditions."
Already the American pika, a cold-loving rodent, is moving to higher elevations, and a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report says, "Climate change is a potential threat to the long-term survival."
The USGS's Klinger, however, said pikas might be more resilient than the wildlife service predicts. "It doesn't hibernate and it has dealt with expanding and contracting snow packs and changing temperatures — and yet it persists," Klinger said.
If the trends continue, some species are expected to adapt by finding more hospitable environments, scientists say. One potential place is Devil's Postpile National Monument in the eastern Sierra, where 40 data collection devices are showing that temperature inversions caused by atmospheric pressure are filling the region of steep canyons with colder air.
Scientists are studying whether other areas with similar features might serve as refuges for some species. They're looking at establishing seed banks in the 800-acre park where several climatic regions overlap and more than 400 plants, 100 birds and 35 animals coexist.
"We have an incredible living laboratory to understand what's happening with this cold air pool," said monument Superintendent Deanna Dulen. "We're really trying to get a good baseline of knowledge so we can look at the changes over time. We have the potential to be a refuge, but also to be a place of increased vulnerability. There's so much to learn."

Hiking in the era of climate change

The front cover of the latest issue of Backpacker Magazine reads "How to Hike In the Era of Climate Change." Indeed, after decades of the alarm being sounded, the reality of climate change is becoming very evident — and the emergency is in the news almost daily. That was not the case when I visited Alaska in the summer of 1989. Back then I was living in the Bahamas and flew, guilt-free, from there to Anchorage. 
I spent a month hitching and hiking around Alaska, and my hike along the Exit Glacier to the Harding Icefield is still one of the most memorable hikes of my life. In the last dozen years, the Exit Glacier has been retreating hundreds of feet annually. The park service had already stopped adding extensions to the Exit Glacier trail in 2010 because the toe of the glacier had become surrounded by treacherous terrain. Having said all that, I'd still love to take my kids on that hike, along what's left of the Exit Glacier to what's left of the Harding Icefield. But, in the era of climate change, should I go back to Alaska? These days, I believe that if you do go somewhere hiking, then that place should be somehow better off for you having been there. And the further afield you go, the more good you need to do. In other words, if you are going to hike it, then you need to do something to save it, too. We can't travel guilt-free anymore. Those days are long gone. Certainly, when we travel to a place, our presence uses local resources and creates waste. So, an obvious remediation activity when traveling can be to participate in some kind of official (or unofficial) clean-up effort. Contributing to a local organization that addresses resource conservation is another option. Of course, exacerbating climate change by traveling is sort of an ugly, catch-22 of nature-based tourism. We are kinda loving these places to death by visiting them. So, offsetting travel-related carbon emissions needs to be on every hiker's to-do list. I suggest "earning" your trip by working to reduce your personal emissions throughout the year. Driving less, flying less, buying local and eating less meat are all things we should be doing anyway — so a big trip can add even more incentive to do those things. Finally, it's still very important to be talking about climate change with your friends and family. Tell them about what you are seeing it do to the places you love. Tell them about what is being lost. Do your best to make them care. We have that responsibility. Likely, no one reading this is living a carbon-neutral lifestyle. So, we are not perfect when it comes to "leaving only footprints" But we nature-lovers, more than any group, should be leading by example when we travel. If we are not, then why should we expect more from anyone else? * Mike Baltz has a doctorate in biology and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.

Dave Lowe found measurable proof of climate change 50 years ago. He's watched in horror ever since.

There's a certificate on the wall of Dave Lowe's small cottage in Petone, Wellington, New Zealand. It could easily be missed by a passing guest. But if they cared to take a second glance, three words would immediately jump out: Nobel Peace Prize. It's the 2007 Prize, awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Lowe was a lead author on their largest-ever report. 
It was by far the greatest honor of his career. He resigned almost immediately afterward, walking away on top of the scientific world. The Prize is a testament to all that he has achieved in his career, but at the same time, to him, it's a haunting reminder of all the things he didn't, or couldn't, change. "I've lived this horror for 50 years," he says. "There's so little time left and we've just been so bloody stupid." Dave Lowe was one of the first people on Earth to find measurable proof that human activities were changing the atmosphere and warming the planet. For the past 50 years, he has watched on, helpless and frustrated, as the situation around him has gotten worse, and worse, and worse. Volcano over clouds The world's largest volcano dominates the skyline of Hawaii's Big Island. The huge, sloping sides and gigantic crater of Mauna Loa cast an imposing shadow and send a constant warning across the Pacific paradise. The Ancient Hawaiians believed Mauna Loa was created by the volcano goddess Pele, who formed it at such an immense height so she could escape the wrath of her sister Namaka, the sea goddess. According to one legend, Pele is accompanied by a phantom white dog. When an eruption was soon to occur, she would send her dog down the mountain to warn the people of the impending disaster. In 1958, an American scientist named Charles David Keeling climbed Mauna Loa, and changed the world's understanding of our climate forever. Keeling had spent the better part of the 1950s perfecting a system of measuring exactly how much of which gases make up Earth's atmosphere. By adapting gas analyzers used in coal mines, he was able to take the first reliable reading of the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. It was here, in two simple gray buildings set against a desolate, otherworldly landscape, that Keeling established the world's first permanent station to measure CO2 levels. The gas analyzer splits a sample of air into 1 million parts, and counts how many of those are CO2. The first measurement Keeling took read 313 parts per million. Then, as he continued to take regular readings, he saw something no one had ever seen before. The planet was breathing. In autumn, as the leaves died off the trees, the amount of CO2 in the air would rise. Then in spring, as the plants grew again, the number would fall again. In and out, like lungs exhaling. Then, when a full year had gone by and the cycle was complete, he checked the number again. It never returned to 313. Now, it sat at 314 ppm. He had just uncovered the first piece of evidence that the total amount of CO2 in the air was increasing. That matters because CO2 has an insulating effect in the atmosphere. It traps heat, which is why it's called a greenhouse gas. More CO2 means more heat. Every year without fail, for the last 61 years, the number has continued to climb. The chart that tracks the rising CO2, that drumbeat on the march to climate breakdown, is called the Keeling Curve. Some would say that the legends of Mauna Loa are true. Pele's white dog has become Keeling's gas analyzer, high in the mountains among the ancient volcanic rock, sending out a warning signal to tell the people of the coming disaster. A worldwide search While Keeling was tracking the first evidence of climate change on a Hawaiian volcano, Dave Lowe was a teenage high school dropout in Taranaki, New Zealand, with only one thing on this mind: surfing. "You go out there and man, do you get a feeling for the environment. I saw the atmosphere directly, going down into the ocean, mixing the sounds, the smells." Sitting on his board, staring out at the mist and the ocean spray dancing against the pink hues of the setting sun, he decided he needed to understand more about the world around him. He went back to school and earned a physics honors degree from Victoria University of Wellington. Lowe and Keeling's paths would cross for the first time in 1970. By this time, Keeling was a giant in his field. But he wasn't satisfied with his research station at Mauna Loa. One measurement at one specific location wasn't enough evidence. He wanted a global record, in both hemispheres, so he could confirm what he was seeing, and track it for future decades. Lowe was a 23-year-old graduate at the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, recruited to join Keeling's team as they set up the world's second continuous record of atmospheric CO2. They found a spot about 30 minutes out of Wellington city, near Makara Beach, at the World War II-era gun emplacements of Fort Opau. The first failed attempts to record atmospheric CO2 in New Zealand were made at Fort Opau, a gun emplacement built in 1941 to protect the Wellington harbor. After six months training in California, Lowe returned to join the small American team of one scientist and two technicians. But pretty soon he found himself with far more responsibility than he expected. "The scientist would constantly just bugger off back to San Diego for six months at a time. And the technicians, well ... they were being paid to have the holiday of their lives. They were always off hunting and fishing, not to speak of the marijuana. "I was thrown in the deep end trying to run hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gear on a really important project which is being funded millions by the National Science Foundation." But that work was for nothing. The readings at Makara were erratic, showing wild swings and no discernible pattern. They were useless. There was about a kilometer of paddocks between the sea and the analyzer that was sucking up too much CO2 and throwing off the readings. Keeling told him he needed to develop a new portable gas analyzer and find a new location, undisturbed by vegetation or outside sources. After some searching, Lowe found the spot he was looking for at Baring Head, a peninsula an hour out of Wellington in the opposite direction, at the base of the Remutaka Forest Park. It was perfect. At the right time, Baring Head gets air currents directly from Antarctica, an incredible undisturbed run through hundreds of kilometers of the Southern Ocean. The first thing they learned was that Baring Head always measured a few ppm behind Mauna Loa. The majority of emissions are produced in the northern hemisphere; this showed that it took time for those gases to spread south. They also found that Baring Head didn't show the same huge seasonal swings as the Mauna Loa readings. The huge continents of vegetation in the northern hemisphere were affecting the Hawaiian readings, but the measurements in the South Pacific, surrounded by ocean, were far more stable. Yet the most important thing was that in both the south and the north, the carbon in the atmosphere was slowly rising. James Renwick is a professor of geology at Victoria University, who was also a contributor to the 2007 Nobel Prize and received last year's Prime Minister's Science Prize. He says Lowe is "a bit of a legend in NZ atmospheric science," and his contributions to the global record of climate change were invaluable. "At the time I suspect it wasn't appreciated just how important the Baring Head Station was, but now the climate science community really values the long time series from Baring Head." "That's very significant," he says. "They are a part of a global network of observing sites that have taught us many things. Dave Lowe has been a real pioneer in atmospheric science in NZ, especially around measurement of greenhouse gases and in understanding the chemistry of the atmosphere and how that's changing." The grind Finding himself in charge of a groundbreaking research with barely any experience, Lowe put everything on his own shoulders. Together with his friend and colleague Peter Gunther, they were basically running the entire southern arm of the operation alone, and they were fully aware of how important their work was. That meant constant flights between Wellington and California, reading every background paper that had ever been written on the subject, developing all the computer programs to drive the calculations. "We worked our butts off," he says. "I knew that I just had to do this. I threw everything I had into it." But that intensity had its consequences. Eventually, something had to give. The single-minded drive Lowe had dedicated to his pursuit of science cost him his marriage. "I just kept on going as my marriage crashed. I was a real mess. A hell of a mess. I was working too hard, and completely blown apart emotionally. "The guy I was working for took a look at me and said, ‘Dave, you're no good to me at all in your condition.'" Proof or persuasion In 1975, Lowe took a sabbatical to recover from his professional and personal blowout. He attended the first scientific conference of greenhouse gas experts. He reckons he's probably the only person at the meeting who is still alive. The small group knew what was coming before anyone else in the world. They had proved that mankind was changing the chemical makeup of the air, and they knew the inevitable outcome of that. The terms "global warming" and "climate change" hadn't been invented yet, but that's exactly what they were seeing. In the following years, Lowe moved to Germany to study further, and met his now-wife Irena. They've been married for 40 years. He specialized in isotopic techniques, which he describes as like DNA tracing for gas particles. Not all the CO2 in the atmosphere is from the burning of fossil fuels. For most of human history, the CO2 level has naturally fluctuated between 200 and 300 ppm, which we know thanks to air samples trapped in glacier ice cores. Those natural fluctuations are often cited by climate deniers to suggest that climate change is not man-made. Naturally occurring carbon is made up of different isotopes. The most common types are called Carbon-12 and Carbon-13. Carbon-12 is by far the most common type found in nature. Carbon-13 makes up about 1% of the total. But the exact amount can differ. There is slightly less Carbon-13 in fossil fuels like coal and oil compared to in atmospheric carbon. Lowe and other international researchers found that while total CO2 in the air was increasing, the percentage of Carbon-13 isotopes compared to Carbon-12 was decreasing. That proved that the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was coming from the burning of fossil fuels by humans, not anything else. "That's the smoking gun. You can get every skeptic blue in the face, but that's just open and shut evidence that this extra CO2 came from humans," he says. That was proof, settled science. But the battle to convince the public of his findings was only just beginning. Part of the problem was that the predicted temperature rise didn't show up for several years. While CO2 was rising, the mercury was jumping up and down, with no consistency. But eventually, the signal separated from the noise and the heat started to climb. Once it did, it basically never stopped. In hindsight, the conservative approach of the scientific community probably held progress back for a number of years, he says. "As a scientists, we thought, ‘No, you don't jump up and down and scream; we're not activists.' Losing our credibility was the big issue. "It was a totally different time. If only I knew then what I know now ... . Now it's different. Many of us are out there doing stuff. We have to. This is an emergency." Full-blown arguments with climate change deniers have been a common occurrence in Lowe's life. His voice bristles with frustration when the topic comes up. "It's better now, but it was hard yards. I'd be yelled at by people. It used to be constant shouting matches with skeptics. "(Scientists) deal in data and facts and graphs and numbers, it's really hard to get through with that. In my lifetime I've given hundreds of climate change talks and you're always up against it with this distrust." Nothing grinds his gears more than scientists in the 1980s and 1990s who deliberately spread mistruths about climate change while on the payrolls of oil companies, like Fred Singer and others profiled in the 2010 book "Merchants of Doubt." "I just think ... the bastard, how dare he not look at the facts. That makes me angry, people who deliberately go out and falsify what's going on." After resigning, Lowe started his own small family business, consulting and doing climate change education. After his children left home, he and Irena moved into their small cottage, which they meticulously designed to have the smallest possible carbon footprint. He's still actively involved in climate science, making submissions on bills and helping with various research work. He's working on a book about his life work. Every day as he sits down to write, that Nobel Peace Prize certificate hangs behind him. "I just wish ... all of us wish, that we could have changed minds," he says. "But how do you fight an oil company?" The first ever CO2 reading at Baring Head was 326 parts per million. The most recent reading was 409 parts per million. * This is republished here as part of Covering Climate Now, a global journalistic collaboration to strengthen coverage of the climate story.

The front cover of the latest issue of Backpacker Magazine reads "How to Hike In the Era of Climate Change." Indeed, after decades of the alarm being sounded, the reality of climate change is becoming very evident — and the emergency is in the news almost daily. That was not the case when I visited Alaska in the summer of 1989. Back then I was living in the Bahamas and flew, guilt-free, from there to Anchorage. 
I spent a month hitching and hiking around Alaska, and my hike along the Exit Glacier to the Harding Icefield is still one of the most memorable hikes of my life. In the last dozen years, the Exit Glacier has been retreating hundreds of feet annually. The park service had already stopped adding extensions to the Exit Glacier trail in 2010 because the toe of the glacier had become surrounded by treacherous terrain. Having said all that, I'd still love to take my kids on that hike, along what's left of the Exit Glacier to what's left of the Harding Icefield. But, in the era of climate change, should I go back to Alaska? These days, I believe that if you do go somewhere hiking, then that place should be somehow better off for you having been there. And the further afield you go, the more good you need to do. In other words, if you are going to hike it, then you need to do something to save it, too. We can't travel guilt-free anymore. Those days are long gone. Certainly, when we travel to a place, our presence uses local resources and creates waste. So, an obvious remediation activity when traveling can be to participate in some kind of official (or unofficial) clean-up effort. Contributing to a local organization that addresses resource conservation is another option. Of course, exacerbating climate change by traveling is sort of an ugly, catch-22 of nature-based tourism. We are kinda loving these places to death by visiting them. So, offsetting travel-related carbon emissions needs to be on every hiker's to-do list. I suggest "earning" your trip by working to reduce your personal emissions throughout the year. Driving less, flying less, buying local and eating less meat are all things we should be doing anyway — so a big trip can add even more incentive to do those things. Finally, it's still very important to be talking about climate change with your friends and family. Tell them about what you are seeing it do to the places you love. Tell them about what is being lost. Do your best to make them care. We have that responsibility. Likely, no one reading this is living a carbon-neutral lifestyle. So, we are not perfect when it comes to "leaving only footprints" But we nature-lovers, more than any group, should be leading by example when we travel. If we are not, then why should we expect more from anyone else? * Mike Baltz has a doctorate in biology and writes about changing the world from his home in Carbondale.

As we enter the final month leading up to the 2020 presidential election, the nationâ€™s attention has been drawn to a series of pre-election debates. Climate change was a hotly discussed topic during the October 7th Vice Presidential Debate between Kamala Harris and Mike Pence, with both sides claiming that they were backing â€˜science.â€™ However, the messages they were taking from the science were significantly different. While Harris supports a version of the sweeping Green New Deal, Pence prefers to protect the environment through protecting the economy and exploring alternative fossil fuels such as natural gas. How can two campaigns each look at the same scientific â€˜factsâ€™ and draw such vastly different conclusions?
 It turns out, a lot of the disagreements are not about the facts at all, but over how drastic the impacts of climate change are expected to be. The Trump Administrationâ€™s analysis of the science of global warming is that the health of the economy poses a much more potent risk than the unknowns of climate change. However, the fact that the consequences of climate change are often unpredictable should lead to more concern, not less â€" as accurate as global warming models have become, there will likely be impacts that nobody could have predicted. The economy is famously bad at responding to unpredictable catastrophes; protecting the global climate now will in turn protect the economy in the future. But just how drastic are the consequences of climate change expected to be? Drastic enough to justify the $2 trillion modified Green New Deal that the Biden campaign is proposing? To answer this, letâ€™s dive into what the climate change models expect the impact of global climate change to be on northern Illinois (including Lake County). The EPA reported in 2016 ¹ that on average, temperatures in Illinois have already increased by one degree Fahrenheit over the past century. However, the most drastic changes are likely to come from precipitation patterns: the bulk of rainfall is going to shift from the summer to the spring, and be more consolidated into heavy rainstorms. One significant impact of this will be the flooding of local watersheds; to read more about how this will impact the Des Plaines River and Libertyville, you can read my blog on â€œthe Des Plaines Riverâ€™s Flooding Problemâ€ at https://marclos.github.io/Climate_Change_Narratives/F2020/Burns.html. Illinoisâ€™ agricultural economy is particularly vulnerable to the double whammy of rain shifts and temperature change. Hatfield (2014) ² describes how earlier rainfall will impact planting times, and more frequent rainstorms and high summer heat risks damaging crops. Even short term exposure to these sorts of stressors result on average in a 15-20% loss in crop yield, which would have a significant impact on Illinoisâ€™ $84 billion annual agriculture industry. As a highly agricultural economy, Illinois clearly has a lot to lose if climate change is allowed to continue unabated. By implementing green infrastructure today â€" such as through a Green New Deal, costly as it is â€" regions such as Illinois can avoid significant economic ramifications of global warming in the future. It just makes good sense. 1 Environmental Protection Agency.

Study blames climate change for 37% of global heat deaths

More than one-third of the world's heat deaths each year are due directly to global warming, according to the latest study to calculate the human cost of climate change. But scientists say that's only a sliver of climate's overall toll — even more people die from other extreme weather amplified by global warming such as storms, flooding and drought — and the heat death numbers will grow exponentially with rising temperatures. 
Dozens of researchers who looked at heat deaths in 732 cities from 1991 to 2018 calculated that 37% were caused by higher temperatures from human-caused warming, according to a study Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change. That amounts to about 9,700 people a year from just those cities, but it is much more worldwide, the study's lead author said. "These are deaths related to heat that actually can be prevented. It is something we directly cause," said Ana Vicedo-Cabrera, an epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventative Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland. The highest percentages of heat deaths caused by climate change were in cities in South America. Vicedo-Cabrera pointed to southern Europe and southern Asia as other hot spots for climate change-related heat deaths. Sao Paulo, Brazil, has the most climate-related heat deaths, averaging 239 a year, researchers found. About 35% of heat deaths in the United States can be blamed on climate change, the study found. That's a total of more than 1,100 deaths a year in about 200 U.S. cities, topped by 141 in New York. Honolulu had the highest portion of heat deaths attributable to climate change, 82%.

The silenced: meet the climate whistleblowers muzzled by Trump

From weakening vehicle emissions to blocking warnings about how coastal parks could flood or the impact on the Arctic, the Trump administration is accused of muzzling climate science. Here, six whistleblowers and former government scientists describe being sidelined by the administration — and why they won't be quiet. Jeff Alson Role: A former senior engineer at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s vehicles lab in Ann Arbor, Michigan What did the work involve? "I was an engineer at the EPA, working for 40 years in a very technical job. In 2009, after the election of Barack Obama, the EPA started working on greenhouse gas standards for vehicles for the first time. 
It felt like we were making history. "There was a team of around 25 people producing thousands of pages of analysis for the standards. We knew it would be controversial but it was a very big deal, the first critical steps to address the climate crisis." What changed under the Trump administration? "Once Trump was elected it became pretty clear that things would change. The president came out to Michigan in March 2017 and gave a speech where he said he'd look at the standards, that they hurt economic activity and jobs. That was an obvious sign, really. "In August 2018 the administration proposed an eight-year freeze of the greenhouse gas standards. It was unbelievable, really — for the first time in the history of the EPA the political leadership decided to change pollution standards that were doing well without allowing the career staff and experts to play any sort of role. We were completely locked out. "There was no scientific or technical rationale to rolling back the standards, the analysis they used was the most biased thing I've ever seen. They cooked the books and changed every assumption they could to get the answer they wanted. It was so bad that some EPA career staff asked their bosses to take the EPA name off it all." How do you feel about your experience? "It broke my heart. I'd had this wonderful career, playing a small role in making the world a better place. Then we had a political leadership making decisions on ideology, denying science, basically being climate deniers. It felt horrible. "I was 62 years old and there were a few family things going on, but the Trump administration made a difficult decision to retire much easier. I felt I could do more good on the outside, educating the public on what's going on. By the time I left, the morale was the lowest I'd seen in 40 years. Our work had become irrelevant." Response from the EPA Asked by the Guardian on Monday about the concerns outlined by four former EPA scientists, the EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said in a statement: "The EPA under President Trump has strived to create an agency that is responsive to the American people." The statement said this included "proposing the SAFE (Safer Affordable Fuel Efficient) rule that will save lives and produce savings for American consumers, working on the first major update to the lead and copper rule in nearly three decades". It added the agency was also "on track to become the first administration to complete an ozone NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) in the five-year review cycle envisioned by Congress", and had deleted 22 sites from the national priorities list of those eligible for Superfund cleanup, the most since the financial year 2005. Maria Caffrey Role: Worked on climate change at the National Park Service (NPS) What did the work involve? "I was studying how climate change will affect 118 coastal parks in the US for the National Park Service. I started this work in July 2013, it was my baby." What changed under the Trump administration? "My study went through peer review and was ready to be released but I was told by the NPS a few days after Donald Trump's inauguration that they were ‘waiting for messaging' first. I thought that was no big deal but then nothing happened and I started calling up every few weeks to say, ‘We've got to get this out, it's getting stale.' "The excuses varied but became ever more vague, such as ‘we are ever so busy' or that it would worry people during hurricane season because it mentions storm surge in coastal areas. A superior said they wanted to keep a low profile on climate change for four or maybe eight years while Trump was around, which really upset me because we don't have four to eight years to do nothing. I felt I was being silenced. "I went on maternity leave around Christmas 2017 and the report still hadn't been released. I got an email from a colleague saying, ‘Congrats on the baby, by the way you should know they are editing your report.' "We had a conference call and it became clear that any mention of human-caused climate change had been taken out. I was asked how I would feel if they didn't release the report at all, which felt like a threat. I stood my ground and was told ‘they aren't going to be happy about this from above.' It was never clear who ‘they' were — perhaps Trump himself or Ryan Zinke [the then secretary of the interior]. "I then had a meeting with a senior NPS official who came out from Washington DC. The other report co-authors were there, too. That's when it all unraveled, it became incredibly hostile. I was told not to attribute changes in public lands to human actions. "I felt like we worked for the American people and I didn't want to lie to them. But a superior said that we in fact work for the executive branch of which the president is the head. The president is the boss and we are going to put our heads down and put out the line of the administration. "A journalist did a freedom of information request and saw all the emails of us fighting over this and asked me for a statement. I ended up going on the record because I thought it was a very important issue. I was aghast I was being asked to lie. These people were violating the mission of the NPS. "After I came back from maternity leave I was demoted to be an intern on $25,000 a year. And then in February this year they said there was no money left at all and that I would have to leave. It was devastating. I offered to work for free as a volunteer but was turned down, which shows that it wasn't a money issue really. I packed up my office and I was gone. I filed a whistle-blower complaint in July." How do you feel about your experience? "I have faced retribution, I was threatened and placed in a hostile work environment. It's clear in some agencies there's a culture of fear where scientists are being intimidated. When I wrote this report, politics was the last thing on my mind, I was thinking about climate change and these coastal parks. "It's very frustrating, it's not where I pictured where my career would be at this time in my life. I don't even know if I have a career any more. What's left is in tatters." The National Park Service did not respond to the Guardian's request for comment. Chris Frey Role: A professor of environmental engineering at North Carolina State University, Frey was chairman of the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee and a member of the agency's Science Advisory Board. He left in 2018 What did the work involve? "The Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (Casac) is required to inform the EPA administrator over air quality standards, if they are sufficient to protect public health or not [under the Clean Air Act]. The EPA's Science Advisory Board is a much larger committee that takes on all sorts of things — clean water rules, vehicle greenhouse gas standards, rules about transparency and so on." What changed under the Trump administration? "Initially there was a neglectful relationship with the new Trump administration; they seemed uninterested and the amount of scientific advisory board work dropped off. Then, from October 2018, there were the first signs of the ideological assault on scientific advice at the EPA. "Scott Pruitt [then administrator of the EPA] wrote a memo that said that researchers that have received grants from the EPA aren't allowed to serve on panels because of a perceived conflict of interest. But there was no prohibition on industry people serving and the number of them on the panels has increased. It's been a way to kick qualified people off the boards and get cronies in their place. "There was a complete turnover of Casac and it shows in meetings. They now bumble through things because they don't understand the process and the Clean Air Act. Political appointees are interfering with the selection of candidates, essentially picking those sympathetic to the agenda of the administration, even if they have fringe views like climate change isn't happening, that kind of stuff. "I was on a panel looking at the risks posed by particulate matter. We had a lot more work to do but we were disbanded four days before the EPA released an assessment that we would've reviewed. The timing was mind-boggling. I found out by seeing a press release on the EPA website, which was followed by an email saying our services were no longer needed. "I was also a nominee for a panel on ozone but then they said they wouldn't go ahead with that. It was a little frustrating for me personally, but it's more of a loss to the American public. The EPA has always been thought of as a science-based agency; what we see now is no basic respect for science." How do you feel about your experience? "There's not even lip service to the science. Science can't be controlled like ideological spin, so the administration is afraid of that. They don't want scientists and their evidence-based opinions — they'd rather have cronies trot out the same tired talking points on fringe scientific views." Joel Clement Role: An expert on the impact of climate change on the Arctic at the Department of the Interior What did the work involve? "I was at [the department of the] interior for nearly seven years. I started on 3 January 2011 — I know the exact date because of how excited and inspired I was at the thought of serving in the federal government. I was hired as a senior executive to run the office of policy analysis, which sits in the office of the secretary. "One of the main areas of focus was addressing the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, which is warming two to three times faster than the rest of the planet. Entire Alaska native villages are threatened by rapid coastal erosion and storms because they no longer have a sea ice curtain to protect them from fierce Arctic storms in the fall and early winter, and the ground beneath their feet is falling away as the permafrost thaws." What changed under the Trump administration? "The new Trump team was very thin and most of them knew very little about the agency mission — they were mostly oil and gas lobbyists and some campaign workers. Whatever they were talking about up on the secretary's hallway, it sure wasn't being shared with the career staff at the agency. So you basically had 70,000 employees scratching their heads and getting back to doing their jobs while a couple dozen political appointees tried to get their act together to lead them. It was surreal. "But this neglect soon turned into scorn, characterized by comments from the new secretary, Ryan Zinke, that the staff were disloyal. Morale began to quickly plummet as the political ranks showed not only ignorance of, but disdain for the wide-ranging agency mission. Here you had tens of thousands of people working hard in public service and being told what they do is not important. "The National Park Service and Fish and Wildlife Service had it worst because they didn't have anything to do with oil and gas or mining permitting process, and the lobbyists in charge had no interest in wildlife, conservation or biodiversity. "But every agency suffered, because the mantra of the administration was to drain the swamp — and it quickly became clear that the swamp was not the high-paid lobbyists, but the rank-and-file government professionals who serve the country. "On a Thursday night in June, just a week after I'd been in New York to speak at the United Nations about climate change adaptation issues, I received an email that said I was being moved to a new position. "It was quickly obvious that this was a retaliatory action, as I was moved away from any climate change work to the office that collects royalty income from oil, gas and mining companies — an auditing position for which I had zero expertise. The email explained that because I had economists on my policy staff that I must clearly know about numbers, so I'd be good in an auditing office. "I'd heard that they were looking for a job that I would not want, in hopes that I would quit. It's not unusual for senior executives to be reassigned, it's part of the job, but reassignment can't be used to get people to quit — and Secretary Zinke testified to Congress a week later that he was using reassignments, among other methods, to trim the workforce. Sadly, I was only one of dozens of executives who were reassigned that night, many of us for clearly retaliatory reasons. "I found legal counsel and eventually filed a whistle-blower complaint and went public with an op-ed in The Washington Post. I wasn't worried too much about my job at that point, I was worried about the work I'd been doing on behalf of Alaska Natives, and it was clear they had no intention of continuing to work to help those frontline communities. "A couple months later I decided that they'd already taken my job, but there was no way I'd let them take my voice, so I resigned and continued to speak publicly about these abuses and the implications for American health and safety." How do you feel about your experience? "The Trump administration is threatened by evidence, by science and by expertise. These things interfere with their ability to hobble government agencies and reduce oversight. It's mind-boggling and a profound threat to democracy but it also increases risks to American health and safety. Every American should be concerned, regardless of political stripe." Response from the interior department A Department of the Interior spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian: "The department works to ensure that the scientific activities that it carries out use the best science and are the result of robust and independent processes." The department said it was required by law to research and publish reports regarding the changing conditions of the climate and has a "rich and long-standing culture of scientific integrity that prevails independently of individual administrations". Betsy Southerland Role: A long-term water quality official at the EPA What did the work involve? "I was at the EPA for 33 years, starting in 1984. I worked in the water program and on Superfund cleanups, working on the criteria for drinkable water." What changed under the Trump administration? "I left in August 2017 and made a very public retirement statement about how bad this administration is and its assault on science. It went viral and since then I spend 20 to 30 hours a week helping the press and Congress understand the impact of what the Trump administration is doing. "We've never seen anything like this complete abandonment of science, solely to maximize corporate profits. Everything changed after the election. The climate change section of the EPA website came down and Scott Pruitt came in and brought in a bunch of political appointees who didn't need Senate confirmation. "I was working on a chemical safety rule that was rewritten by Nancy Beck, someone from the American Chemistry Council [an industry lobby group] who Pruitt brought in. It basically repeated the talking points she used on the chemistry council. "Pruitt never spoke to any of the career staff before he made decisions on replacing rules. I worked on a rule that would require coal-fired power plants to treat toxic waste rather than simply dump it into leaky ponds. Pruitt met with Bob Murray [head of the coal mining firm Murray Energy Corporation] and decided to postpone the rule and the first we knew about it was when we were asked to check a draft press release about the rollback. "Scientists are really irrelevant at the EPA now, their input isn't requested. They are simply directed by the political team to help fulfill the desires of political donors, no matter the cost to Americans. At the moment it's just a logistical question of how fast they can go on this. They have something like 70 regulation repeals under way and because it will be hard to do this with legal challenges they want to undermine the underlying science." What happened after you left? "Within a couple of days of me leaving an opposition research firm did a freedom of information request for all my emails and the EPA immediately handed them over. I found out they made a big effort to connect with all the right-wing media to trash me. They made up this lie that I was being paid more than a Congress member for every year of my retirement. It got really ugly, so I got off social media. "The same opposition group then tried to find out if any EPA employees donated to [Bernie] Sanders or [Elizabeth] Warren. It's stunning to target federal employees like that. I've never seen that before." Jacob Carter Role: Worked on climate change impacts upon Superfund sites (toxic areas requiring federal cleanup) at the EPA What did the work involve? "I was brought in by the EPA to do climate change work for the office that oversees the Superfund site program, which are toxic areas that require a federal cleanup. "I was specifically working on the Superfund site program because President Obama had issued an executive order for any federal agencies that would put forward new federal dollars into infrastructure. Essentially, he wanted those agencies to incorporate climate change into flood risk for that infrastructure. "The model essentially looks at how much sea level rise is expected over the next 100 years. Plus what did the extreme floods look like in those areas? And I combine those two sets of data to create a model that is predictive of these future extreme floods that we're seeing more of currently and are expected to see more of in the future." What changed under the Trump administration? "I knew from President Trump, then candidate Trump's campaign, how he felt about climate change, that I was likely on the chopping block because I was a postdoctoral fellow and my contract was sort of on a year-to-year basis. "And so after the transition occurred, I was there for a couple of weeks and then one day my boss came to my office and said: ‘I think you should probably start looking for another position.'" How do you feel about your experience? "It was a very difficult time for me, absolutely. I was extremely sad and depressed. I really liked the work that I was doing. I felt like I was doing research that was really going to have a significant impact. "I had worked really hard on it. To see something like that just get sort of tossed out the window was really disheartening to see. And the fact that they were just going to completely dismiss this climate change work altogether was also really disheartening. So, yeah. It was a very sad time for me. I will not lie. "There's a ton of different scenarios that have occurred that show that this administration really does not care about progressing climate change or climate science, in general. "I mean, any time you see some sort of report come out of the agency that even mildly mentions climate change and maybe its impacts to national parks, or something to that extent, the administration tries to downplay human connection to climate change. They try to downplay the role of climate change and federal scientists' work in press releases. "They try to downplay the role of climate change and research that they're funding. So even in grants that the agencies are receiving, they're now being vetted by political officials to essentially make sure that climate change is not mentioned in those proposals. It's not a great time to be a climate change scientist in the federal government." * This story originally ran on theguardian.com website.

Chicago museum exhibit drives home climate change

Climate change can be hard for people to understand because humans are adaptable. But other life-forms aren't so lucky.
"We don't have to shiver or pant, we can just change the AC," said Steve Sullivan, senior curator of urban ecology for the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum. "Other species can't do that. Change from a biological standpoint is impossible for most organisms. If this summer is half a degree warmer, climatologists are going to freak out but homeowners won't notice a difference."
The museum is helping to educate visitors on the causes and effects of climate change, and how they can help, through the exhibit "Weather to Climate: Our Changing World," which runs in Chicago through Oct. 23 before heading out on tour.
"Climate change is really the defining issue of our time, and we saw that as an issue that we as an institution could address," Sullivan said. "We also noticed that a lot of museums rent traveling exhibits that address pressing issues, but oddly there are no really good, moderately sized traveling exhibits on climate change."
The exhibit opens by explaining the difference between weather and climate, letting kids play dress up in front of a mirror to see how their clothes may change frequently, like the weather. But climate — like a person's wardrobe — is typically consistent over time, depending on where you live. Residents of Hawaii, for example, might wear heavy jackets on occasion, but their overall wardrobe will be lighter than if they lived in Chicago.
"If you look at the political debate, a lot of times we conflate weather and climate," Sullivan said. "The weather you are experiencing at this moment is a data point. It's really kind of irrelevant. That collection of data points that are studied over 30 years equals a meaningful climate data point. When we look at that overall picture, not just what's happening today or yesterday, is when we can really see what's going on."
Kids can also take on the role of a meteorologist, donning suit jackets, standing in front of a green screen in a mock television studio and reading weather reports off a teleprompter while they see themselves amid graphics.
"At the most superficial level you're just interacting with this goofy, fun thing and seeing pictures of weather," Sullivan said. "At the most sophisticated level the text is informing the audience of how weather and climate are changing and
how this affects people."
The middle section of the exhibit addresses the effects of climate change using mounted specimens of red and gray squirrels as an example.
Kids can also spin a wheel of fortune showing different animals and weather conditions they could be exposed to. A video then explains the potential effects. For instance the pika, a miniature rabbit with short ears, lives in high elevations and wouldn't mind colder temperatures. But pikas — who spend cold months eating stores of hay — would not get enough food to survive the winter if it was too wet.
"These specific plants and animals are adapted to specific climactic regimes," Sullivan said. "As those climates change, those animals may be able to adapt, they may be able to move.
But most things that have to adapt to change in the world simply go extinct."
The exhibit ends by exploring how humans are impacting climate change. A sculpture incorporates 94 balls, each filled with a cubic foot of air to represent the amount of carbon dioxide the average American puts out in a day through the burning of fossil fuels.
By following tips for reducing their carbon footprint, visitors can help prevent climate change from getting worse.
"We want to end on a note that empowers people and, importantly, we want to end on a positive note that makes them feel like they can make a difference," Sullivan said.

Kerry says climate summit can yield ‘enormous progress'

MILAN — U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said Saturday he thinks "enormous progress" can be made at the upcoming U.N. climate talks in Scotland but more governments must come up with concrete commitments in the next 30 days. Kerry attended a preparatory meeting in Milan where delegates from around the world sought to identify where progress can be made before the U.N. climate change starts in Glasgow on Oct. 31. The 12-day summit aims to secure more ambitious commitments to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius with a goal of keeping it to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels. The event also is focused on mobilizing financing and protecting vulnerable communities and natural habitats. 
"The bottom line is, folks, as we stand here today, we believe we can make enormous progress in Glasgow, moving rapidly towards the new goals that the science is telling us we must achieve,'' Kerry said. That means achieving a 45% reduction in carbon emissions in the next 10 years. "This is the decisive decade,'' Kerry said. Kerry, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, said that countries representing 55% of the world's gross domestic product — Britain, Canada, Japan, the United States and the 27 European Union members — have submitted plans that hit the 1.5 degrees target by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But the American diplomat also noted that the 89 new national submissions ahead of the summit would only cut emissions by 12%, and that the sum of all 191 submissions as they are currently written would increase emissions between now and 2030 by 16%. Kerry declined to single out any country but said there are ways to achieve lower emissions that aren't that expensive, including organizing power grids and making transmissions more efficient. China is the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the United States is second. Kerry said U.S. President Joe Biden has had "constructive" talks on the subject with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kerry also highlighted commitments by India's leader to install 450 gigawatts of renewable power over the next decade. "Glasgow, my friends, is around the corner. It is the starting line of the race of centuries and the race of this decade," he said. "All countries have to sprint and join together to understand that we are all in this together.'' Kerry added "This is the test of collective multilateralism to the highest level that I have seen in my public career." The European commissioner for climate action, Frans Timmermans, separately underlined the importance of meeting the $100 billion annual funding commitment to help vulnerable countries fight climate change during 2020-2025, as demanded by youth activists who met earlier in Milan. Timmermans said the financing needs going forward would be much greater than that amount and that public funding alone would not be able to cover the anticipated price tag, which runs in the trillions. Already the Earth has seen a 1 degree Celsius temperature change and unpredictable weather patterns that have destroyed harvests and killed livelihoods around the world, Timmermans said. "So there can be no doubt in anybody's mind that we are fighting for the survival of humanity, and that the climate crisis and the threatening ecocide are the biggest threat humanity faces,'' Timmermans said. "We need to change, and we need to change radically and we need to change fast. That's going to be bloody hard. That's the bad news.'' Alok Sharma, Britain's president for COP26, said "delivering on (the) $100 billion is absolutely a matter of trust." He also said the presence of youth delegates and activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate, ahead of the climate summit preparatory meetings had energized the process. "As we go forward of the next few weeks and into COP, we must always keep the voices of the young people foremost in our minds and think about what their response would be to the outcomes that we reach,'' Sharma said.

After 17 months of the COVID 19 pandemic, we have learned just how important indoor spaces are and their connection to our health and wellbeing. But what many people may not know is the connection those indoor spaces have to the climate crisis. In fact, the design, construction and operations of our buildings is responsible for 40% of CO2 emissions, directly impacting climate change. The good news?
 It also means our buildings have the potential to be 40% of the solution. And here in Illinois, our buildings are leading the way through green building. Today, the state of Illinois is home to more than 3,000 LEED certified green buildings, putting the state at number three in the nation for LEED certified green buildings per capita. That&amp;#8217;s nearly three-square feet of green building space per person! The benefits of LEED and green buildings go far beyond reduced water and energy usage, affecting the health and prosperity of entire communities. LEED-certified projects save money for families, businesses and taxpayers, in addition to reducing carbon and creating a healthier environment in which people can thrive. From an investor perspective, they are also a critical component of demonstrating progress toward achieving ESG commitments. Just last month, Illinois passed the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (SB2408). The first of its kind, this law is designed to fight climate change, create good-paying jobs, improve the health of Illinoisans and support underserved communities. Illinois is also among top states to receive the most funds from President Biden&amp;#8217;s infrastructure bill. The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly approved the $1 trillion infrastructure bill earlier this month in an effort to rebuild the nation&amp;#8217;s crumbling roads and bridges and fund new climate resilience and broadband initiatives. The administration touts that the infrastructure plan &amp;#8220;will grow the economy, enhance our competitiveness, create good jobs&amp;#8221; and improve a variety of other metrics. This infrastructure will offer our state even more opportunities to take advantage of green building strategies. Additionally, in 2018, Chicago achieved LEED for Cities Platinum certification, the highest level of certification, making Chicago one of the first cities in the world to be certified using LEED. LEED for Cities and Communities helps local leaders create responsible, sustainable and specific plans for natural systems, energy, water, waste, transportation and many other factors that contribute to quality of life. The certification programs revolutionize the way cities and communities are planned, developed and operated in order to improve their overall sustainability and quality of life. The LEED framework encompasses social, economic and environmental performance indicators and strategies with a clear, data-driven means of benchmarking and communicating progress. Today, more than 100 cities across the globe are LEED certified. This summer, the village of Northbrook, Ill., adopted a plan in line with LEED for Cities. Northbrook's Climate Action Plan (CAP) aims to reduce carbon emissions and foster a sustainable community for all. This is a Village-wide goal of 35% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 80% by 2040, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement and LEED for Cities. LEED buildings save tax dollars on utility bills and support local economic development. As more state and local governments seek to increase resilience, mitigate climate risks and reduce emissions, improving the performance of their buildings is a critical and effective strategy. States like Illinois are an example of how to create holistic and integrated approaches to sustainability. By embracing programs like LEED and sustainable planning, Illinois is leading the way in green building and the climate crisis.

Caucus will play key role on climate change

Citizens and observers of our federal government are rightly worried by the growth of extreme partisanship. We've seen the repercussions in appointments of judges and other officials, hampering government's ability to function. Add to that the recent funding of government through short-term resolutions, with lawmakers exacerbating lack of trust of their colleagues. While those concerns are justified, it's also important to recognize positive signs when they occur, and the role that we, as citizens, can play toward nurturing bipartisanship. 
Would it surprise you, for example, to learn that large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House have signed up to look for bipartisan ways to address climate change? Based on national headlines, this would seem unlikely, given how partisan climate change has become. Extended court fights over the EPA's Clean Power Plan instituted under President Obama, are now followed by its dismantling under President Donald Trump's EPA chief Scott Pruitt. Objectively, climate change should be a fairly obvious area for bipartisanship. It's a well-understood problem, with costly repercussions. For example, new research shows that climate change contributed to increased rainfall in hurricane Harvey and to the severity of California's recent six-year drought. The mounting risks from climate change include damage from sea level rise, and more extreme weather. There's nothing partisan about these facts. They point to a problem we need to solve. Damages from storms, droughts and coastal erosion don't single out victims based on their political leanings. The problems presented by climate change are causing attitudes to shift in Congress. Conservatives understand that they bring valuable perspectives to this problem, by helping government promote market mechanisms in the design of fair and effective climate policy. This spirit of collaborative problem-solving led to the formation of the House Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2016. The caucus was started by two South Florida representatives, Democrat Ted Deutch, and Republican Carlos Curbelo. The caucus requires members to join in pairs, one from each party; membership is kept bipartisan with strictly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The caucus' objective is clear from its name: design and pass bipartisan legislation to solve the problem of climate change. Over the last year, 44 new members have joined the caucus. The most recent to join are Chicago region Reps. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from the 9th Congressional District in Illinois, and Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican from the 6th Congressional District in Michigan, who announced on Jan. 26 that they have joined together. The caucus now has 68 members, 34 from each party, and over 15 percent of the total U.S. House. These two will join prior members from the Illinois delegation, Reps. Dan Lipinski and Rodney Davis, who joined separately last March. The addition of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton is particularly significant for their leadership roles on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which both serve (Rep. Upton is former committee chair).

Citizens and observers of our federal government are rightly worried by the growth of extreme partisanship. We've seen the repercussions in appointments of judges and other officials, hampering government's ability to function. Add to that the recent funding of government through short-term resolutions, with lawmakers exacerbating lack of trust of their colleagues. While those concerns are justified, it's also important to recognize positive signs when they occur, and the role that we, as citizens, can play toward nurturing bipartisanship. 
Would it surprise you, for example, to learn that large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. House have signed up to look for bipartisan ways to address climate change? Based on national headlines, this would seem unlikely, given how partisan climate change has become. Extended court fights over the EPA's Clean Power Plan instituted under President Obama, are now followed by its dismantling under President Donald Trump's EPA chief Scott Pruitt. Objectively, climate change should be a fairly obvious area for bipartisanship. It's a well-understood problem, with costly repercussions. For example, new research shows that climate change contributed to increased rainfall in hurricane Harvey and to the severity of California's recent six-year drought. The mounting risks from climate change include damage from sea level rise, and more extreme weather. There's nothing partisan about these facts. They point to a problem we need to solve. Damages from storms, droughts and coastal erosion don't single out victims based on their political leanings. The problems presented by climate change are causing attitudes to shift in Congress. Conservatives understand that they bring valuable perspectives to this problem, by helping government promote market mechanisms in the design of fair and effective climate policy. This spirit of collaborative problem-solving led to the formation of the House Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in February 2016. The caucus was started by two South Florida representatives, Democrat Ted Deutch, and Republican Carlos Curbelo. The caucus requires members to join in pairs, one from each party; membership is kept bipartisan with strictly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. The caucus' objective is clear from its name: design and pass bipartisan legislation to solve the problem of climate change. Over the last year, 44 new members have joined the caucus. The most recent to join are Chicago region Reps. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from the 9th Congressional District in Illinois, and Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican from the 6th Congressional District in Michigan, who announced on Jan. 26 that they have joined together. The caucus now has 68 members, 34 from each party, and over 15 percent of the total U.S. House. These two will join prior members from the Illinois delegation, Reps. Dan Lipinski and Rodney Davis, who joined separately last March. The addition of Reps. Schakowsky and Upton is particularly significant for their leadership roles on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, on which both serve (Rep. Upton is former committee chair). In addition to the crucial concern of climate change, there are important lessons in the formation of the Bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. The first is a message of hope: that our representatives reveal themselves to be decent people committed to serving our nation and their constituents. While they are members of political parties, and often compete bitterly to win elections, they still agree that the best policies emerge from building consensus across political divides.

Climate report: Worse to come Study released by the White House contradicts Trump on global warming Climate: Severe weather to get more intense, U of I scientist says

The federal government on Friday released a long-awaited report with an unmistakable message: The effects of climate change, including deadly wildfires, increasingly debilitating hurricanes and heat waves, are already battering the United States, and the danger of more such catastrophes is worsening. The report's authors, who represent numerous federal agencies, say they are more certain than ever that climate change poses a severe threat to Americans' health and pocketbooks, as well as to the country's infrastructure and natural resources. And while it avoids policy recommendations, the report's sense of urgency and alarm stand in stark contrast to the lack of any apparent plan from President Donald Trump to tackle the problems, which, according to the government he runs, are increasingly dire. The congressionally mandated document — the first of its kind issued during the Trump administration — details how climate-fueled disasters and other types of worrisome changes are becoming more commonplace throughout the country and how much worse they could become in the absence of efforts to combat global warming. Already, western mountain ranges are retaining much less snow throughout the year, threatening water supplies below them. 
Coral reefs in the Caribbean, Hawaii, Florida and the United States' Pacific territories are experiencing severe bleaching events. Wildfires are devouring ever-larger areas during longer fire seasons. And the country's sole Arctic state, Alaska, is seeing a staggering rate of warming that has upended its ecosystems, from once ice-clogged coastlines to increasingly thawing permafrost tundras. The National Climate Assessment's publication marks the government's fourth comprehensive look at climate-change impacts on the United States since 2000. The last came in 2014. Produced by 13 federal departments and agencies and overseen by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the report stretches well over 1,000 pages and draws more definitive, and in some cases more startling, conclusions than earlier versions. "We are seeing the things we said would be happening, happen now in real life," said another co-author Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. "As a climate scientist it is almost surreal." And Donald Wuebbles, a co-author and University of Illinois climate scientist, said, "We're going to continue to see severe weather events get stronger and more intense." The authors argue that global warming "is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us." And they conclude that humans must act aggressively to adapt to current impacts and mitigate future catastrophes "to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades." "The impacts we've seen the last 15 years have continued to get stronger, and that will only continue," said Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that reviewed the report. "We have wasted 15 years of response time. If we waste another five years of response time, the story gets worse. The longer you wait, the faster you have to respond and the more expensive it will be." That urgency is at odds with the stance of the Trump administration, which has rolled back several Obama-era environmental regulations and incentivized the production of fossil fuels. Trump also has said he plans to withdraw the nation from the Paris climate accord and questioned the science of climate change just last month, saying on CBS's "60 Minutes" that "I don't know that it's man-made" and that the warming trend "could very well go back." Furthermore, as the Northeast faced a cold spell this week, Trump tweeted, "Whatever happened to Global Warming?" This shows a misunderstanding that climate scientists have repeatedly tried to correct — a confusion between daily weather fluctuations and long-term climate trends. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday's report. However, the administration last year downplayed a separate government report calling human activity the dominant driver of global warming, saying in a statement that "the climate has changed and is always changing." Given that history, some of the hundreds of scientists and federal officials who spent months working on the detailed document were frustrated, but not surprised, that the administration chose to release it on the day after Thanksgiving — typically one of the slowest news days of the year. Several people involved in the report said its release originally had been planned for early December, but after a behind-the-scenes debate in recent weeks about when to make it public, administration officials settled on Black Friday. Several federal experts who participated in a media call after the release of the report on Friday were repeatedly asked about the timing of its release on a day when the country's attention is likely elsewhere. For the most part, they demurred, saying that in part the report was finished early and that they wanted to make sure it was out ahead of both an American Geophysical Union gathering next month, as well as a major international climate conference in Poland around the same time. Rather, they implored reporters to focus instead on the contents of the report, which they said had not been tinkered with by administration officials. "This report has not been altered or revised in any way because of political considerations," Monica Allen, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), told reporters. She said the decision on when to release it had been made during the past week, but added, "It's not as significant as the content of what's in the report." Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said the report shows how climate change will affect all Americans. "No matter how hard they try, the Trump administration can't bury the effects of climate change in a Black Friday news dump — effects their own federal government scientists have uncovered," he said in a statement. "The president says outrageous things like climate change is a hoax engineered by the Chinese and raking forests will prevent catastrophic wildfires, but serious consequences like collapsing coastal housing prices and trillions of dollars in stranded fossil fuel assets await us if we don't act." That report is striking in its clear statement that climate change is not only already affecting the U.S., but that the effects are getting worse. "This report draws a direct connection between the warming atmosphere and the resulting changes that affect Americans' lives, communities, and livelihoods, now and in the future," the document reads, concluding that "the evidence of human-caused climate change is overwhelming and continues to strengthen, that the impacts of climate change are intensifying across the country, and that climate-related threats to Americans' physical, social, and economic well-being are rising." The report finds that the continental United States already is 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was 100 years ago, surrounded by seas that are on average nine inches higher and being racked by far worse heat waves than the nation experienced only 50 years ago. But those figures offer only the prelude to even more potentially severe impacts. The report suggests that by 2050, the country could see as much as 2.3 additional degrees of warming in the continental United States. By that same year, in a high-end global-warming scenario, coral reefs in Hawaii and the U.S. Pacific territories could be bleaching every single year — conditions in which their survival would be in severe doubt. A record-warm year like 2016 would become routine. Key crops, including corn, wheat and soybeans, would see declining yields as temperatures rise during the growing season. The city of Phoenix, which experienced about 80 days per year over 100 degrees around the turn of the century, could see between 120 and 150 such days per year by the end of the century, depending on the pace of emissions. And those who face the most suffering? Society's most vulnerable, including "lower-income and other marginalized communities," researchers found. In another major step, the authors of the new report have begun to put dollar signs next to projected climate damage, specifically within the United States. In a worst-case climate-change scenario, the document finds, labor-related losses by the year 2090 as a result of extreme heat — the sort that makes it difficult to work outdoors or seriously lowers productivity — could amount to an estimated $155 billion annually. Deaths from temperature extremes could take an economic toll of $141 billion per year in the same year, while coastal property damage could total $118 billion yearly, researchers found. Of course, mitigating climate change would also mitigate this damage, by as much as 58 percent in the case of high-temperature related deaths, the report finds. The categorical tone of the new assessments reflects scientists' growing confidence in the ability to detect the role of a changing climate in individual extreme events, such as heat waves and droughts.

Looking back at 2018's weather-related news, it seems clear that this was the year climate change became unavoidable. I don't mean that the fires in California, coastal flooding in the Carolinas, and drought throughout the West were new evidence of climate change. Rather, they shifted the national mindset. They made climate change a political issue that cannot be avoided. 
The Earth's climate changes all the time. But what we're seeing today is different: the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather. Wet places are becoming wetter; dry places are growing dryer; where it was hot a generation ago, it's hotter now; where it's historically been cool, it's growing warmer. The global impact of human activity — specifically, the burning of hydrocarbons — is shuffling the deck. And we're only beginning to grasp the impact on our political and economic systems. Warmer overall temperatures, for instance, have lengthened the growing season across the U.S. — by about two weeks compared to a century ago. But the impact on fruit and grain production isn't just about the growing season: plant diseases are more prevalent, and the insects that are vital to healthy agricultural systems are struggling. Insects that spread human diseases, like mosquitoes and ticks, are flourishing. Precipitation is also changing. There will be more droughts and more heat waves, which will become especially severe in the South and West and in cities. This is troubling news. Extreme heat, according to the Centers for Disease Control, "often results in the highest number of annual deaths among all weather-related hazards." In other words, it kills more people than other weather-related disasters. The human cost and strain on public resources of prolonged heat waves will be extensive. The rise in sea levels will be even more disruptive. Sea levels have been increasing since we began burning fossil fuels in the 1880s, but the rise is occurring at a faster rate now, something like six to eight inches over the past century — compared to almost nothing during the previous two millennia. This already poses a threat to densely populated coastal areas — in the U.S., about 40 percent of the population, or some 120 million people, lives directly on the shoreline. And that's without the very real potential of melting glacial and polar ice, with calamitous results. It's not just that this would affect coastal cities, it would also scramble the geopolitical order as nations like the U.S., Canada, and Russia vie for control over the sea lanes and newly exposed natural resources. I'm not mentioning all this to be alarmist. My point is that dealing with climate change constitutes a huge, looming challenge to government. And because Americans are fairly divided in their beliefs about climate change — a division reflected in sharp partisan disagreements — policymakers struggle to come up with politically viable approaches. This makes the adverse impacts of climate change potentially much worse, since doing nothing is clearly a recipe for greater disaster. The problem is that politicians in Washington like to talk about climate change in general, yet we haven't seen any concerted consensus-building effort to deal with it. Occasionally you'll see bills being considered in Congress to study it more, but unless we get real, this will dramatically change our way of life. And despite the growing impact of extreme weather, the opposition's point — that policies to fight climate change will impose hardship on working people, especially in manufacturing states — still has some merit and political legs. In response to inaction in Congress and the administration, some states have taken important steps to address climate change, even though it's best dealt with on the federal level. Still, newer members of Congress appear to have more of an interest in addressing climate change than older, senior members. And the issue holds particular resonance for younger millennial voters, whose political influence will only grow over coming elections. Only recently have thoughtful politicians I talk to begun to ask whether the political system can deal with the challenges posed by climate change before its impact becomes unstoppable. The one thing we agree on is that climate change and how to deal with it will place real stress on the system in the years ahead. Former congressman Lee H. Hamilton is a senior adviser for the Indiana University Center on Representative Government.

Energy from pig slurry helps fight climate change

STERKSEL, Netherlands — The 2,700 pigs on the farm that John Horrevorts manages yield more than ham and bacon. A biogas plant makes enough electricity from their waste to run the farm and feeds extra wattage into the Dutch national grid.
He even gets bonus payments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
As the world struggles to reduce pollution causing climate change, attention has focused on the burning of fossil fuels in factories, power stations, and vehicles. But U.N. scientists says farming and forestry account for more than 30 percent of the greenhouse gases that are gradually heating the earth. Much of that pollution comes from cattle, sheep and pigs that belch or excrete methane, a heat-trapping gas more than 20 times as potent as carbon dioxide, the most common global warming gas.
Negotiators from 190 countries have been working to reach a new climate change agreement in December on ways to reduce emissions and help countries adapt to changes in climate. They will reconvene June 1 in Bonn, Germany, for another two-week session.
Yet it is uncertain whether cutting agricultural emissions will be part of the agreement expected to emerge at the final meetings in Copenhagen, Denmark. The subject is complex, emissions are difficult to measure, and the whole question is politically sensitive, touching on the distrust between the world's rich and poor countries.
Scientists say it is too important to be left out.
"It would be absolutely nuts to ignore agriculture and forestry in any future climate deal," said Pete Smith, professor of soils and global change at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.
U.N. studies say agriculture is the main source of income for one of every three working people. It also is a growing source of pollution, as the global population increases and living standards rise in developing countries where more people are eating meat.
The latest research by the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization says animal husbandry accounts for 18 percent of all greenhouse gases, when taking into account the grassland and forests that are cleared for raising livestock.
When the FAO report came out in 2006, "people in the livestock sector were shocked because they thought they did a good job," says Akke van der Zijpp, a professor of animal husbandry at Wageningen University, a premier Dutch technical facility. Now they "are becoming slowly aware that this problem has to be solved."
One way to deal with it is to reduce the methane animals produce by changing their diet or through breeding.
Another is to make use of it and burn it.
Horrevorts says Wageningen University's Praktijkcentrum, or Sterksel Research Center, creates 5,000 megawatts a year, enough to power 1,500 homes. The farm uses the electricity it needs and feeds the rest into the national grid, for which the government pays up to euro177 ($238) per megawatt as a green energy subsidy.
Pigs can be remarkably housebroken animals. Here, they drop their waste through slats on the floor in the middle of the barn while spending most of their time in open stalls to the side. The slurry is channeled into three 4,000 cubic meter (141,250 cubic feet) tanks, then mixed into a thick goo with other organic waste like low-quality grain and carrot juice to increase the methane potential. Bacteria break down the material in a digester tank and the gas is siphoned off into a generator to produce electricity.
Horrevorts says a group including his operation and four other commercial farms avoids methane emissions equivalent to 40,000 tons of carbon a year. Dozens of private or nonprofit companies known as offset providers will "buy" those tons as a way of supporting renewable energy or other projects that reduce carbon emissions, then resell the credits to individuals or companies who want to shrink their carbon footprint.
Last year, Horrevorts said, a British offset provider paid euro5 ($6.70) per ton for people wanting to neutralize plane travel or rock concert tickets. This year, the farm was negotiating with a Dutch company seeking to become carbon neutral to promote a green image.
Though operating expenses for the biogas plant are considerable, the combination of electricity savings, power production and carbon credits makes it profitable, Horrevorts says.
Horrevorts, who is a biological researcher rather than a professional farmer, says that with financial incentives through electricity subsidies, it could become standard practice for ordinary farmers. About 50 commercial biogas plants operate on farms in the Netherlands, and the practice is spreading across industrial livestock farms around the world.
"I think in the future every pig farm will have a biogas plant," he says.
But at euro1 million ($1.3 million) for a big plant like Sterksel's, it's a rich man's answer to climate change. About 70 percent of the world's agriculture is on small land holdings in the developing world, which complicates climate politics, says Antonio Hill of the nonprofit group Oxfam International.
"It sounds like a big pot," Hill said, but dealing with farming is tougher than with industries. "You're talking about tens of thousands of sources of industrial emissions in rich countries. That's a lot more manageable than hundreds of millions of agricultural operations."

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Saturday called on lawmakers worldwide to overcome "the narrow confines" of partisan politics to quickly reach consensus on fighting climate change. The pope addressed parliamentarians who were in Rome for a preparatory meeting before the U.N's annual climate conference, which begins in Glasgow, Scotland, on Oct. 31. Francis referred to a joint appeal he and other religious leaders signed this week that calls for governments to commit to ambitious goals at the U.N. conference, which experts consider a critical opportunity to tackle the threat of global warming. 
"To meet this challenge, everyone has a role to play,'' Francis told the visiting lawmakers from many countries. "That of political and government leaders is especially important, and indeed crucial." "This demanding change of direction will require great wisdom, foresight and concern for the common good: in a word, the fundamental virtues of good politics,'' Francis said. Before his speech, Francis gave a private audience to Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. "His Holiness's leadership is a source of joy and hope for Catholics and for all people, challenging each of us to be good stewards of God's creation, to act on climate, to embrace the refugee, the immigrant and the poor, and to recognize the dignity and divinity in everyone," Pelosi said in a statement after her audience with Francis. She called the pontiff's 2015 encyclical exhorting people to protect the environment "a powerful challenge to the global community to act decisively on the climate crisis with special attention to the most vulnerable communities." During their encounter, Pelosi expressed gratitude "for the immense moral clarity and urgency that His Holiness continues to bring to the climate crisis," the statement said. Francis, 84, said earlier he intended to participate in the U.N.'s upcoming COP26 conference, but the Vatican announced Friday that he would not attend and the Vatican delegation would be led by the secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. No explanation was given.

Record U.K. flooding: Latest symptom of El Nino, climate change? -BYLN- By Chelsea Harvey The Washington Post

December witnessed a spate of extreme global weather events, from deadly tornadoes in the southern U.S. to bushfires in Australia — and the latest development is a series of record-breaking floods in the United Kingdom, brought on by torrential rain starting in the first week of the month.
Thousands of homes in the north of England are believed to have been affected already, and the region is reeling again from a new wave of flooding just brought in this week with the onset of Storm Frank.
There's been much discussion about the causes behind the surprising rash of winter storms in the region (Frank is the third major storm to hit within a month), and equal suspicion has fallen on the effects of climate change and the influences of this year's particularly potent El Nino event. It can be difficult to parse exactly what's going on, though.
Nicola Maxey, a press officer from the Met Office (the U.K.'s national weather service), noted in an email to The Washington Post that it was too early to say for sure whether climate change was a major contributor to this winter's extreme rainfall — but added that evidence from both physics and the study of weather systems suggests that it may have played a part.
The Met Office, in fact, recently published a report in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society examining the causes behind dozens of extreme weather events in 2014, including similarly severe rainfall in the U.K. in the winter of 2013/2014. Using models, the report concluded that anthropogenic climate change likely had a hand in the extreme conditions that winter — the highest rainfall since 1931 — and that climate change increases the chances of extreme rainfall during a time period of 10 consecutive winter days by a factor of seven.
So while scientists frequently warn that individual weather events can't always be considered an indicator of long-term climatic patterns, the research in this case suggests that climate change is increasing the odds of extreme winter weather events in the UK. This is in keeping with research from all over the world that suggests that extreme weather, in general, is likely to increase in frequency and intensity all around the world as a result of climate change.
"I think it is fair to conclude that human-caused climate change here too increased the flooding potential of the recent storms," said Michael Mann, distinguished professor of meteorology at Penn State University, in an email to The Post. "While climate change didn't ‘cause' the storms themselves, it has increased the potential for heavy rainfall and flooding with these storms."
On the other hand, Maxey pointed out that El Nino, which increases the likelihood of warmer and wetter winters in the U.K., could also be at play in the recent events — but she added that it's "just one of many drivers that affect the UK weather and there are many other factors which could override this signal."
So parsing between the two — human-caused climate change, on the one hand, and naturally occurring El Nino, on the other — can seem confusing. But experts are increasingly arguing that the U.K. downpours — along with many of the other unusual weather events being witnessed around the globe as 2015 came to a close — are likely the product of both forces interacting and ultimately making each other worse.
El Nino itself is not a product of climate change at all. Rather, it's a naturally occurring cycle, coming around every four to seven years or so, that brings unusually warm temperatures to the Pacific Ocean, generally with significant consequences for global weather patterns. This year's is believed to be among the strongest El Nino events ever recorded.
Because its effects are often similar to those predicted to be caused by climate change, including unseasonably warm temperatures in some regions and an increase in storms and other extreme weather events, it can be hard to definitively say which events are caused by which phenomenon. In fact, the claim that certain extreme weather events are the product of El Nino, and not human-caused climate change, is sometimes seized upon by climate doubters arguing that increases in extreme weather patterns are simply the product of naturally occurring processes.
However, this doesn't change the fact that climate change is a continuous process that's still happening even in El Nino years. What's more likely, given the severity of this season's event and the strange weather that's accompanied it, is that the ongoing influence of climate change is simply making this year's El Nino event even worse.

Politics interfere with scientific reasoning FACT: Clean air and clean water are crucial. In 1980, the so-called experts were saying the world would freeze over because of pollution. TIME magazine and National Geographic and others reported this. Then, a few years later in 2000, the S-CEs were clamoring that the world would be covered with water in 12 years because of global warming. Apparently, the S-CEs were going the wrong way on the thermometer. 
The facts weren't adding up. What happened then? Let's call it "Climate Change," which is reported in the news media as Fact now. Not so fast. I'm a big believer in common sense. How could scientists conclude there is global cooling? Then, in a blink of an eye 20 years later, the earth is on a trajectory of global warming. That doesn't make sense, does it? Keep in mind, the earth went through a global warming period. Illinois was covered with glaciers up to 10,000 years ago. The melting of glaciers in Illinois wasn't caused by humans, was it? Several publications disagree about global warming. The NIPCC report on scientific consensus titled, "Why Scientists Disagree About Global Warming" is a good source to read. It argues that there is no consensus among scientists, there are flawed projections and postulates, unreliable circumstantial evidence, etc. In conclusion, to be fair, scientists always should be in the business of disproving hypotheses. The political climate is getting in the way of scientific reasoning. Let's allow the debate to flourish and allow scientists to debate global cooling, global warming, or the temperature is within historical norms. In the meantime, for those who know the world will end in I guess 10 years, please send me your money. You won't be needing it. I'll be happy to use it for good purposes. Michael Fuechtmann Roselle Celebrities and secular science I recently read about Greta Thunberg being named Time's Person of the Year. Greta Thunberg and celebrity actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who is publicly supporting Ms. Thunberg, are two people without a background in science. And yet their opinions on climate change are apparently highly respected by many. When a once-Christian nation becomes secular, that nation rejects the ultimate authority of God's word and replaces such with the science and opinions of men. As we now know, science, like man's opinions, is ever changing. The corrupt science and emotionally fueled opinions of celebrities are poor substitutes for the wisdom of God. When I was a boy, quite a few years ago, there was an actor that they called the King of Hollywood. His name was Clark Gable. Clark Gable described himself as, "A lucky slob from Ohio." Unlike today's celebrities Mr. Gable never saw his fame as something that gave him wisdom greater than the average American. There was another man of humility that I remember from childhood. Broadcast and print journalist Edward R. Murrow. Mr. Murrow commented on self-important celebrities this way: "Just because your voice reaches halfway around the world doesn't mean you are wiser than when it reached only to the end of the bar." Currently America is at great risk. We steer our ship by the capricious opinions of celebrities and by the deceitful conclusions of scientific experts. Many years ago sailors would guide their ships to safe harbor at night by focusing on the lighthouse. That lighthouse was a constant. It never moved, and so it was a faithful guide. My prayer is that in these dark secular days, America will decide to guide our nation to safe harbor by focusing on God's word, which is a constant. It never changes Charles Danyus Round Lake Beach, Even naughty kids don't deserve lumps of coal Santa might want to rethink his strategy these days. No matter how poorly kids behave, they don't deserve to wake up on Christmas morning to coal in their stockings. When the burning of coal and other fossil fuels is destroying the future of all kids, this is just too cruel. Whether naughty or nice, our kids deserve a clean world in which to live. It's not too late to turn things around. There is a bill in Congress that has the support of conservative, liberal and moderate citizens that would be a great start on giving our kids that clean world. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (HR 763) would put a steadily rising price on carbon and give the net revenue to U.S. citizens in equal shares. The free market takes care of the rest as people and industry choose cheaper clean energy over dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels. As long as Santa leaves the coal in the ground, his visit will make even our naughty kids smile. And if we do our jobs as citizens and call our legislators about HR763, we can give that smile a chance to last a life time. Mark Ailes Lombard Support candidates whose eyes are open Scientific study after study has reported that human-caused global warming is the greatest threat of our time. However, Trump and most Republicans pretend that human-caused climate change doesn't exist, use fake or irrelevant facts or claim it's a negligible issue. Their responses remind me of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast from the planet Traal, described in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Beast assumes that "if you can't see it, it can't see you." So you can avoid disaster by shutting your eyes. Unlike avoiding the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast, shutting your eyes won't stop climate heating. It still would cause increasing crises in the next decade and will make life unbearable for your children and grandchildren. This is why Marie Wilson's Dec. 2 article on 6th District congressional candidates should be required reading. She reports that Republican candidates Ives and Kinzler say climate warming isn't important to them or district residents. In contrast, Congressman Sean Casten agrees with all reputable scientific studies that climate warming is the single biggest existential threat we face. While Ives and Kinzler are keeping their eyes tightly shut, Rep. Casten is working on bills that would increase the nation's green energy storage capacity, would help develop ways to produce materials without emitting carbon, supports other efforts to mitigate climate changes and, along with the U.S. military, seeks ways to protect our nation against the climate-caused catastrophes that already have begun occurring. This month, he is participating with other Democrats in the annual United Nations Climate Change discussions (COP25). Those who shut their eyes to climate warming along with Ives and Kinzler and other Republican candidates are stealing their children's and grandchildren's future. Please vote to re-elect Sean Casten. Darold Barnum Oak Park It's incomprehensible to deny climate change. The oddest thing about climate change is not the fact of it, but the dialogue about it. Look, the climate is changing, the data is clear. The world is warming. Why is this a political discussion? Why does one party line up to deny man-made climate change? Good news: At least Florida's politicians are finally getting it. Maybe because it affects that state directly. A scientist can point to charts and tables, but that's when the deniers' eyes glaze over. Let me just add one recent datum: Greenland's ice is melting faster than expected and could add 26 inches to sea level by 2100. Source: ScienceFocus.com, BBC and others. Climate change is not a hoax, as some who are politically motivated maintain. Did you ever see a greenhouse on a cold snowy day? The green plants inside are doing just fine. Greenhouse gases work the same way that greenhouse glass works. It's not a political question. You can't lobby Mother Nature. Here are the arguments: "The climate is always changing." Well, yes. Just like there have always been car accidents and for lots of different reasons; does that mean we should barrel through red lights? "The predictions are wrong." Yes, many have been off somewhat. But, so have many of Newton's (you know, the apple and the tree guy) gravity predictions until modified slightly by Einstein. An apple will still fall from a tree despite errors in Newton's law. Even though Newton was wrong, no one is encouraged to walk off a roof. Let's say nine of out 10 doctors tell you that a life threatening tumor you have must be removed as soon as possible. Let's say one out of 10 says, "Nah ... let's wait to see what happens." Which doc's advice would you follow? Sanford Morganstein West Dundee

NEW YORK — Greta Thunberg turned 18 in January, but she's already made peace with her future: While most college students will change their concentrations multiple times, the Swedish high school student says climate change activism will be her life's mission. "In a perfect world, there wouldn't need to be a climate activist, but unfortunately, there will probably still be a need for climate activists for quite some time," she said. "I think I will be doing this for as long as there is a need for people to do this." Thunberg's activism and message is brought to life in a new docuseries, "Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World." 
The three-part series, a coproduction between PBS and BBC Studios premiering Thursday on Earth Day, follows the then-16-year-old as she took a gap year from school in 2019 to meet with scientists around the world and spearhead awareness about climate change. The docuseries shows her visiting people and places that have been distinctly affected by the heating of the Earth, such as Canada's Athabasca Glacier, a town in California burned by wildfires and the Indigenous Sami herders in Sweden where reindeer face starvation. She even sails across the North Atlantic during the ocean's busiest season to experience how carbon dioxide emissions from ships have altered the chemistry of the ocean. "A Year to Change the World" also gives a behind-the-scenes look at her speaking at massive rallies, and also reveals how her momentum was significantly slowed by the worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Thunberg, a 2020 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, said while she grew even more knowledgeable about climate change, there were moments that surprised her, like meeting with Polish coal miners. "I had expected them to not be willing to change, but they were willing to change. They wanted to live in a more sustainable world ... as long as they were not left behind," said Thunberg. "I've met with world leaders who are less eager to change." And it's many of those heads of government that have positioned Greta as a political lighting rod and inadvertently raised her global profile. Brazil's conservative president Jair Bolsonaro has called her a "brat," Russian President Vladimir Putin has said she doesn't understand that the "modern world is complex," and former President Donald Trump mentioned her at rallies, which resulted in cascades of boos. He even famously tweeted, "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill, Greta, Chill!" Thunberg, the youngest person ever to receive Time's Person of the Year honor in 2019, said she doesn't fully understand why she's on the radar of government officials, but it shows that the message of climate change is reaching far and wide. "When people like that do these kinds of things and say these kinds of things, of course, it's very hilarious," said Thunberg. "It's a sign that we are doing something good, that we are having an impact, so that we take it as a compliment." But Thunberg says she believes what's most intriguing about the new project is what the filmmakers weren't able to include. "I think maybe the most interesting thing about the documentary series is what didn't get into the series. I don't know how many fashion companies like H&amp;M, car companies like Volkswagen, oil companies like Shell and airlines and so on that we asked for interviews, but they all refused consistently. And that, I think is very interesting — it says a lot about them." While U.S. PBS stations and BBC Earth in Canada air the docuseries Thursday, Thunberg will be at her school in Sweden, which reopened in-person classes to one day a week. She'll also use Earth Day to testify virtually to the U.S. Congress, along with scientists, about fossil fuel subsidies. Thunberg says she understands that changing the world — or even getting her fellow global citizens to care about how's it's changing — will not happen overnight, but she wants everyone to be aware about how their daily actions can affect future generations. "I'm not telling anyone to care," said Thunberg. "But if you want yourself and your children and grandchildren to be able to live in a prosperous world and in a world where they can enjoy all the things in life that you have gotten to enjoy, then you should care. But of course, that's up to you. I'm not telling you to do something — saving the world is voluntary."

‘We can't wait any longer': Biden aims for most ambitious U.S. effort on climate change

WASHINGTON (AP) — In the most ambitious U.S. effort to stave off the worst effects of climate change, President Joe Biden issued executive orders Wednesday to cut oil, gas and coal emissions and double energy production from offshore wind turbines. The orders target federal subsidies for oil and other fossil fuels and halt new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. They also aim to conserve 30 percent of the country's lands and ocean waters in the next 10 years and move to an all-electric federal vehicle fleet. Biden's sweeping plan is aimed at slowing human-caused global warming, but it also carries political risk for the president and Democrats as oil- and coal-producing states face job losses from moves to sharply increase U.S. reliance on clean energy such as wind and solar power. "We can't wait any longer" to address the climate crisis, Biden said at the White House. 
"We see with our own eyes. We know it in our bones. It is time to act." He said his orders will "supercharge our administration's ambitious plan to confront the existential threat of climate change." Biden has set a goal of eliminating pollution from fossil fuel in the power sector by 2035 and from the U.S. economy overall by 2050, speeding what is already a market-driven growth of solar and wind energy and lessening the country's dependence on oil and gas. The aggressive plan is aimed at slowing human-caused global warming that is magnifying extreme weather events such as deadly wildfires in the West and drenching rains and hurricanes in the East. Biden acknowledged the political risk, repeatedly stating that his approach would create jobs in the renewable energy and automotive sectors to offset any losses in oil, coal or natural gas. "When I think of climate change and the answers to it, I think of jobs," Biden said. "We're going to put people to work. We're not going to lose jobs. These aren't pie-in-the-sky dreams. These are concrete actionable solutions. And we know how to do this." In a change from previous administrations of both parties, Biden also is directing agencies to focus help and investment on the low-income and minority communities that live closest to polluting refineries and other hazards, and the oil- and coal-patch towns that face job losses as the U.S. moves to sharply increase its reliance on wind, solar and other energy sources that do not emit climate-warming greenhouse gases. Biden pledged to create up to a million jobs building electric cars, as well as installing solar panels, wind turbines, "capping abandoned walls, reclaiming mines, turning old brownfield sites into the new hubs of economic growth." Even so, Republicans immediately criticized the plan as a job killer. "Pie-in-the-sky government mandates and directives that restrict our mining, oil, and gas industries adversely impact our energy security and independence," Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "At a time when millions are struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the last thing Americans need is big government destroying jobs, while costing the economy billions of dollars," she said. Biden also is elevating climate change to a national security priority. The conservation plan would set aside millions of acres for recreation, wildlife and climate efforts by 2030 as part of Biden's campaign pledge for a $2 trillion program to slow global warming. President Donald Trump, who ridiculed the science of climate change, withdrew the U.S. from the Paris global climate accord, opened more public lands to coal, gas and oil production and weakened regulation on fossil fuel emissions. Experts say these emissions are heating the Earth's climate dangerously and worsening floods, droughts and other natural disasters. Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb called the executive orders an "excellent start" for the new administration. "If this Day 7 momentum is representative of this administration's 4-year term, there is every reason to believe that we might achieve carbon neutrality sooner than 2050," even as key roadblocks lie ahead, Cobb said. Biden's actions came as his nominee for energy secretary, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, faced deep skepticism from Republicans as she tried to pitch the president's vision for a green economy. "The last Democratic administration went on a regulatory rampage to slow or stop energy production," said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a leading Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "I'm not going to sit idly by ... if the Biden administration enforces policies that threaten Wyoming's economy." Granholm, as the leader of a state devastated by the 2008 recession, said she knew what it was like to "look in the eyes of men and women who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own." She promoted emerging clean energy technologies, such as battery manufacturing, as an answer for jobs that will be lost as the U.S. transitions away from fossil fuels. Granholm and other officials said the investment in cleaner energy national will net millions of jobs. But that probably will take years to happen, and the orders will face intense opposition from oil and gas and power plant industries, as well as from many Republican — and Democratic — lawmakers. "The environmental left is leading the agenda at the White House when it comes to energy and environment issues,? said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas drillers in Western states. The group filed a legal challenge soon after Biden signed the orders. Biden is seeking to double energy production from offshore wind after the Trump administration slowed permit review of some giant offshore wind turbine projects. Significantly, he is directing agencies to eliminate spending that acts as subsidies for fossil fuel industries. "The fossil fuel industry has inflicted tremendous damage on the planet. The administration's review, if done correctly, will show that filthy fracking and drilling must end for good, everywhere," said Kierán Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has pushed for the drilling pause. Oil industry groups said Biden had already eliminated thousands of oil and gas jobs by killing the Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office. "Do not be fooled, this is a ban" on drilling, said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. "The Biden administration's plan to obliterate the jobs of American oil and gas explorers and producers has been on clear display." The pause in onshore leasing is limited to federal lands and does not affect drilling on private lands, which is largely regulated by states. It also will not affect existing leases and could be further blunted by companies that stockpiled enough drilling permits in Trump's final months to allow them to keep pumping oil and gas for years. The order exempts tribal lands, mainly in the West, that are used for energy production. Biden also will direct all U.S. agencies to use science and evidence-based decision-making in federal rule-making and announce a U.S.-hosted climate leaders summit on Earth Day, April 22. Associated Press writers Alexandra Jaffe and Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.

Climate change is a scam to share wealth
Thank you, President Trump, for withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate accord.
In the 1980s, thousands of leaked British University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit emails reveal the results of global warming research, were often faked, altered, or discarded to produce the desired conclusion. Even NASA admitted they excluded weather reporting stations if temperature readings did not reflect a warming trend. Commonly ignored, astronomers noted at that same time Mars and other solar bodies were also experiencing warming, indicating "global warming" on earth was part of a celestial phenomenon and not man-made.
In the 1990s, the term "global warming" had to be switched to "climate change" because global warming was obviously not happening. Unexplained by the man-made climate change advocates is why has our planet had numerous cycles of ice ages and thaws millions of years before the advent of humans?
Anyway, the goal of the Paris climate accord is not to control the climate; it is the world's greatest scam to control the people and share the wealth, OUR wealth.

The world's wealthy will need to reduce their carbon footprints by a factor of 30 to help put the planet on a path to curb the ever-worsening impacts of climate change, according to new findings published Wednesday by the United Nations Environment Program. Currently, the emissions attributable to the richest 1% of the global population account for more than double those of the poorest 50%. Shifting that balance, researchers found, will require swift and substantial lifestyle changes, including decreases in air travel, a rapid embrace of renewable energy and electric vehicles, and better public planning to encourage walking, bicycle riding and public transit. But individual choices are hardly the only key to mitigating the intensifying consequences of climate change. Wednesday's annual "emissions gap" report, which assesses the difference between the world's current path and measures needed to manage climate change, details how the world remains woefully off target in its quest to slow Earth's warming. The drop in greenhouse gas emissions during this year's pandemic, while notable, will have almost no impact on slowing the warming that lies ahead unless humankind drastically alters its policies and behavior, the report finds. 
Instead, nations would need to "roughly triple" their current emissions-cutting pledges to limit the Earth's warming to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average — a central aim of the Paris climate agreement. To reach the loftier goal of holding warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report found, countries would need to increase their targets at least fivefold. That goal in particular would require rapid and profound changes in how societies travel, produce electricity and eat. "We'd better make these shifts, because while COVID has been bad, there is hope at the end of the tunnel with a vaccine," Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said in an interview. "But there is no vaccine for the planet." Global carbon dioxide emissions are likely to fall by about 7% during 2020 — a significant change driven by the spread of the coronavirus and the shutdowns that accompanied it, which had a particularly strong impact on travel. But that temporary dip probably will have only a "negligible long-term impact" on climate change in the years ahead, the U.N. report found. If the drop in emissions caused by the pandemic proves an isolated event rather than the beginning of a major trend, the episode will prevent only .01 degree Celsius (.018 degree Fahrenheit) of warming by the year 2050, the report found. Last year's "emissions gap" report found that humans would need to collectively cut emissions by close to pandemic amounts (7.6%) every year to begin to meet the Paris agreement's most ambitious climate goals. That is nowhere near to becoming a reality. "Are we on track to bridging the gap? Absolutely not," the new report bluntly states. Global greenhouse gas emissions have risen about 1.4% annually on average over the past decade. Last year saw the highest global emissions ever recorded, at 59 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, a category that includes not only the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, but also methane and other climate-warming agents. Based on countries' current promises, U.N. researchers found, the world remains on a trajectory to experience a temperature rise this century of about 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) — an amount that many experts say would have catastrophic effects on much of the planet. Bending that disturbing curve in a more sustainable direction will require fundamental, unprecedented changes on the part of leaders around the globe. But as Wednesday's report makes clear, individual behavior also has a role to play. And the wealthy — whom the report defines as those with the highest 1% of incomes globally, or more than $109,000 per year — bear the greatest responsibility for helping fuel such a shift. (The "1%" in the United States, a wealthy country, are considerably richer than average, with annual household incomes above $500,000.) Wealthy people are more likely to travel frequently by car and plane and to own large, energy-intensive homes. They tend to have meat-rich diets that require large amounts of greenhouse gases to produce. They buy the bulk of carbon-costly appliances, clothing, furniture and other luxury items. Residents of the United States — the world's largest historical source of planet-warming emissions — have some of the most carbon-intensive lifestyles. The carbon footprint of the average American is about 17.6 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents a year, about twice the footprint of a person living in the European Union or the United Kingdom, and almost 10 times that of the average Indian citizen's 1.7 tons annually. If the world is to achieve the kind of sweeping societal transformation needed, limiting consumption "will be really important," said Surabi Menon, vice president of global intelligence at the ClimateWorks foundation and a member of the report's steering committee. And yet, although it is hard to argue with the numbers overall on the emissions consequences of more affluent lifestyles, this approach to rapidly changing people's ways would likely prove contentious. "Shaming people and nations and demanding they change never has or will work," said Frank Maisano, a senior principal at Bracewell, a law firm that works with a variety of energy companies in multiple sectors. "What is necessary is creating modestly increasing political, technology and cultural successes that build upon each other to create meaningful overall change." Still, this year's pandemic might offer clues about how humans could achieve those cuts, Menon added. People are flying less, teleworking more and making fewer luxury purchases. "The question is, how do you keep these new behaviors we learned this year, but in a more sustainable way?" she said. The latest sobering snapshot of the world's uphill battle to halt warming comes amid constant reminders of the urgency of the problem, as well as ongoing uncertainty about whether world leaders can summon the political will to take the actions scientists say are necessary. Already, 2020 is on pace to be one of the warmest years on record, marked not only by a crippling pandemic but also devastating wildfires, scorching droughts and a startling number of hurricanes in the Atlantic basin. A separate report Tuesday, led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that the Arctic as a whole is warming at nearly three times the rate of the rest of the world. "To put it simply, the state of the planet is broken," U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said in an address last week at Columbia University, in which he pleaded that world leaders act with more urgency. He pointed to the collapse of biodiversity, the bleaching of coral reefs, and "apocalyptic" fires and floods. He noted that global emissions are 62% higher now than when international climate negotiations began three decades ago. "Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal," Guterres warned. "Nature always strikes back, and it is already doing so with growing force and fury." Wednesday's report does not paint an entirely bleak view of the future. Governments around the world have spent $12 trillion boosting their economies in the wake of the pandemic — an unprecedented injection of public funds. The authors found that if leaders around the world seize the opportunity to invest heavily in renewable energy and other green infrastructure as part of a post-COVID stimulus, the world could trim as much as 25% from its predicted 2030 emissions. "We are in the middle of the pandemic, and recovery packages can still be shaped to solve the economic and the climate crises at the same time," Niklas Höhne, a German climatologist and founding partner of NewClimate Institute, and a contributing author to Wednesday's report, said in an email. "This is the one chance we have. Governments will not spend this much money again in 10 years." Still, the report found little evidence that most countries, at least so far, have prioritized climate-friendly stimulus; instead, they have mainly funded existing industries, many of them carbon-intensive. "Large shares of resources still support fossil fuels with waivers of environmental regulations and bailouts of fossil fuel ... companies without environmental conditions," Höhne said. A growing number of countries have committed to eliminate their net emissions entirely by midcentury. The report notes that at least 126 nations, representing 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions, have either announced or are considering such a goal. That number is likely to grow in the coming months, with a similar pledge widely expected from the United States under the incoming Biden-Harris administration. Although such promises offer hope of a dramatic shift in the next decades, most nations have yet to back them up with concrete action. "What's very exciting is that countries have now come out with these declarations on net zero," said Andersen, the UNEP chief. "Now, they need to sit down and do the hard work of telling us how they are going to get there." In his speech last week, Guterres pleaded for a more equitable, thoughtful world to emerge from the pandemic. "We cannot go back to the old normal of inequality, injustice and heedless dominion over the Earth," he said. And yet, studies have shown that the economic impacts of the coronavirus have most battered developing countries, the working poor, women and racial minorities. In the United States, billionaires have seen their wealth grow this year while millions of Americans head into the holidays unemployed, behind on rent and dependent on food banks for their next meal. Research suggests that greater inequality within countries makes them less able to tackle climate change. The more wealth is concentrated at the top, the more powerful people tend to insulate themselves from the effects of warming and resist meaningful climate action. To make the extraordinary changes necessary in the years to come, the United States and other nations will need to overcome the habits of the past. "We worry about the recovery being K-shaped: The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and inequality keeps widening," Menon said. "I'm very mindful that those kinds of inequalities can really hamper any kind of climate progress that is made."

A ‘mass invasion' of polar bears is terrorizing an island town. Climate change is to blame.

Fences have risen around kindergartens. Special vehicles transport military personnel to their work sites. Residents of the island settlement are afraid to leave their homes. Novaya Zemlya is a Russian archipelago stretching into the Arctic Ocean. It once played host to Soviet nuclear tests, including the largest-ever man-made explosion, when the so-called King of Bombs detonated in 1961, releasing 50 megatons of power and deepening an arms race that threatened to turn the Cold War hot. 
Today, the barren landscape is under siege — from dozens of polar bears locked in their very own sort of hot war. Marine ecologists have long been sounding the alarm about the peril posed by global warming for the vulnerable species. In the far reaches of Russia, the situation has suddenly become traumatic for humans, too. Officials in the Arkhangelsk region, where the archipelago lies, on Saturday declared a state of emergency because of the marauding mammals. Polar bears are typically born on land but live mostly on sea ice, where they hunt and feed on seals. But as arctic ice thins, which is linked to the acceleration of climate change, the animals move ashore, ravenous. They scavenge, sometimes coming into contact with human populations. At least 52 bears were massed near Belushya Guba, the main settlement on the island territory, which is still used as a military garrison, with restricted access to the public. The town had a population of about 2,000 as of the 2010 Census. Now, they could be selectively slaughtered if Russian authorities can't figure out another way to keep them from menacing the residents of the remote island outpost, where they began to collect in December 2018. Warning of the "mass invasion of polar bears in residential areas," local officials vowed action in response to "numerous oral and written complaints demanding to ensure safety in the settlement." Officials also said the situation was unprecedented. "I have been in Novaya Zemlya since 1983, but there has never been so many polar bears in the vicinity," said Zhigansha Musin, a local administrative head, according to TASS, Russia's state news agency. TASS reported that the animals had tried to enter office buildings and residential quarters, and that they had chased residents and engaged in other aggressive behavior. Photos and video footage posted over the weekend showed polar bears parading through drab living spaces, appearing on playgrounds, staring down dogs and feasting on garbage. "The people are scared," regional officials reported in a statement. "They are frightened to leave homes and their daily routines are broken. Parents are afraid to let the children go to school or kindergarten." Meanwhile, vehicle patrols and brigades of dogs appeared to make no difference. The mammals were undeterred, continuing to pose a "threat to the life and health" of residents, officials said. More drastic measures were required. Residents are barred from hunting the animals, which are classified as a vulnerable species because of the "ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change," according to the World Wildlife Fund. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that there are currently somewhere between 22,000 and 31,000 polar bears worldwide. So far, Russia's environmental watchdog has withheld licenses for shooting the troublesome animals. Instead, a team of experts is being sent to the remote island community to try to protect the residents. "However, provided that those measures do not help solve the situation, a cull will remain the only and forced answer," TASS reported, suggesting that killing the animals as a means of population control was possible. The polar bears are battling adverse conditions of their own, driven by changing conditions in the Arctic, which is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet, according to a 2013 study in the journal Nature. Models suggest that arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of nearly 13 percent per decade. Scientists also pointed to climate change as the reason for the aggressive behavior of a sloth of polar bears that surrounded a weather station in the Arctic in 2016, threatening a team of Russian researchers. The animals wreaking havoc on Novaya Zemlya ventured inland on the southern end of the archipelago, where the ice is rapidly thinning, Ilya Mordvintsev, a researcher at the Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution, told TASS. On their way north, where the ice is thicker, they came across alternative sources of food at Belushya Guba and stopped to feed on the waste. But a garbage-based diet won't properly nourish polar bears, whose energy demands require "high-fat prey," as detailed in a 2014 paper in the journal Science. The marine animals are highly vulnerable to climate change, the authors found, because of their dependence on icy conditions in acquiring their preferred fare, seals, as well as other animals that sustain them, including fish and waterfowl. When a polar bear's carnivorous needs aren't met, or when it has to travel farther and faster to sate itself, its body condition suffers. A female's reproductive capacities may falter. The U.S. Geological Survey warned in 2007 that two-thirds of the global population of polar bears could be wiped out by 2050 because of thinning sea ice. That prediction has periodically found stark visual expression. In December 2017, the world's attention was briefly focused on a video of an emaciated polar bear, struggling to stand in the Canadian Arctic. "This is what starvation looks like," Paul Nicklen, the photographer who captured the scene, wrote on social media. "The muscles atrophy. No energy. It's a slow, painful death. When scientists say polar bears will be extinct in the next 100 years, I think of the global population of 25,000 bears dying in this manner." The Canadian photographer described the scene as "soul-crushing," but said he was moved to share it in an attempt to "break down the walls of apathy." The marine invasion in Russia, in testing the nerves of the local population, is also testing how firmly those walls stand.

Since retiring from her practice of corporate law, Alisa Singer, founder of Environmental Graphiti, has devoted herself to creating art that furthers the causes she believes are important.
With climate change being one such cause, Singer conceived the Environmental Graphiti project in 2014 and created The Art of Climate Change, a series of abstract images derived from the science behind the critical changes affecting the planet. Brushwood Center is welcoming this art series to the Brushwood Gallery with an opening reception from 1-3 p.m. June 11. The reception is free and no registration is required.
Singer was attracted by the inherently aesthetic design elements of scientific charts and graphs and intrigued by the idea of using art to give them dramatic effect. Each of Singer's vibrant digital paintings is printed on metal and uses a graph, chart, map, word, or number relating to a key fact about climate change as its "blueprint."
Using a wild array of bold colors, she turns science into art to dramatize the compelling facts about what is happening to our world, connecting audiences to science and nature through the art she creates.
Environmental Graphiti delivers a message about climate change in a unique and powerful way. Singer says: "Art makes the science more accessible. Science makes the art more meaningful. They are a potent combination. Once viewers understand that each piece is derived from a key indicator or fact about climate change, they are intrigued and become more engaged with both the art and the underlying message."
To further enrich the dialogue between art and science that Environmental Graphiti has created, Brushwood Center has invited Field Museum Climate Change Ecologist Dr. Katherine Moore Powell to speak.
Dr. Moore Powell has studied the ecology and hydrology of wetlands in Florida and the effect of changing seasonal rain patterns on carbon and water cycling in grasslands in Colorado, and is now developing a climate change adaptation plan for the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
Her June 11 talk, "The Faces Behind the Graphs," will explore the people behind the research that supports climate change.
Although there are decades of research and thousands of publications behind the data that support climate change research, there is usually little known about the people who have worked so hard to study the Earth and its many complex systems. Their stories will parallel the story of climate change and the inspiration for the art.
Environmental Graphiti creates a dialogue at the intersection of art, nature, and science — a perfect fit for the gallery at Brushwood Center, where the mission is to promote the importance of nature for nurturing personal and community well-being, cultivating creativity, and inspiring learning. The show will run June 11 through July 31.
For more information, visit www.brushwoodcenter.org/Programs/Art/ArtExhibitions/EnvironmentalGraphi ti.html.
Brushwood Center is at 21850 N. Riverwoods Road, Riverwoods.

Trump on climate change evidence: ‘People like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers.'

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed a landmark report compiled by 13 federal agencies detailing how damage from global warming is intensifying throughout the country, saying he is not among the "believers" who see climate change as a pressing problem. The comments marked the president's most extensive yet on why he disagrees with his own government's analysis, which found that climate change poses a severe threat to the health of Americans, as well as to the country's infrastructure, economy and natural resources. The findings — unequivocal, urgent and alarming — are at odds with the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations and absence of any climate action policy. "One of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers," Trump said during a freewheeling 20-minute Oval Office interview with The Washington Post in which he was asked why he was skeptical of the dire National Climate Assessment his administration released Friday. "As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it," he added. 
Trump did not address the fundamental cause of climate change. The president riffed on pollution in other parts of the world. He talked about trash in the oceans. He opined on forest management practices. But he said little about what scientists say is actually driving the warming of the planet — emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels. "You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a record clean. But when you look at China and you look at parts of Asia and you look at South America, and when you look at many other places in this world, including Russia, including many other places, the air is incredibly dirty, and when you're talking about an atmosphere, oceans are very small," Trump said in an apparent reference to pollution around the globe. "And it blows over and it sails over. I mean we take thousands of tons of garbage off our beaches all the time that comes over from Asia. It just flows right down the Pacific. It flows and we say, ‘Where does this come from?' And it takes many people, to start off with." Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, said in an email Tuesday that the president's comments risk leaving the nation vulnerable to the ever-growing impacts of a warming planet. "Facts aren't something we need to believe to make them true — we treat them as optional at our peril," Hayhoe said. "And if we're the president of the United States, we do so at the peril of not just ourselves but the hundreds of millions of people we're responsible for." Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, struggled to find a response to the president's comments. "How can one possibly respond to this?" Dessler said when reached by email, calling the president's comments "idiotic" and saying Trump's main motivation seemed to be attacking the environmental policies of the Obama administration and criticizing political adversaries. In his comments, Trump also seemed to invoke a theme that is common in the world of climate-change skepticism — the idea that not so long ago, scientists feared global cooling, rather than the warming that is underway today. "If you go back and if you look at articles, they talk about global freezing," Trump said. "They talk about at some point, the planet is going to freeze to death, then it's going to die of heat exhaustion." This may refer to an oft-cited 1975 Newsweek article titled "The Cooling World" or a 1974 Time magazine story titled "Another Ice Age?" But researchers who have reviewed this period have found that while such ideas were indeed afoot at the time, there was "no scientific consensus in the 1970s" about a global cooling trend or risk, as there is today about human-caused climate change. In other words, scientists' understanding of where the planet is headed, and the consequences, is far more developed now than it was in the 1970s. At present, Earth has warmed roughly one degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) above late-19th-century, preindustrial levels. Multiple analyses have shown that without rapid emissions cuts — well beyond what the world is undertaking — the warming will continue and could blow past key thresholds that scientists say could lead to irrevocable climate-related catastrophes, such as more-extreme weather, the death of coral reefs and losses of major parts of planetary ice sheets. On Tuesday, a U.N. report underscored again how the world is far off course on its promises to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. The report found that, with global emissions still increasing as of 2017, it is unlikely they will peak by 2020. Scientists have said that carbon emissions must fall sharply in coming years if the world is to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change. Trump also made reference to recent devastating wildfires in California, which scientists say have been made more intense and deadly by climate change. But the president instead focused on how the forests that burned have been managed. Previously, he has praised Finland for spending "a lot of time on raking and cleaning" its forest floors — a notion that left the Finnish president flummoxed. "The fire in California, where I was, if you looked at the floor, the floor of the fire, they have trees that were fallen," Trump said. "They did no forest management, no forest maintenance, and you can light — you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months. And it's a massive problem in California." "You go to other places where they have denser trees, it's more dense, where the trees are more flammable, they don't have forest fires like this because they maintain," he said. "And it was very interesting I was watching the firemen, and they were raking brush ... It's on fire. They're raking it, working so hard. If that was raked in the beginning, there would be nothing to catch on fire." Trump wasn't the only administration official on Tuesday to continue shrugging off the federal government's latest climate warnings. In a television appearance in California, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke acknowledged that fire seasons have grown longer in the state but added, "Climate change or not, it doesn't relieve you of responsibility to manage the forest." Meanwhile, asked Tuesday about the findings of the nearly 1,700-page climate report the administration released on Black Friday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders echoed her boss. "We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts," Sanders said of the National Climate Assessment. "It's not data-driven. We'd like to see something that is more data-driven. It's based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate. Again, our focus is on making sure we have the safest, cleanest air and water."

Climate change is real, and it's happening now. The good news is that solutions exist. But we must act decisively, and soon.
There is a lot of denial and intentional misinformation about this issue. But it's happening, whether or not we want to believe it. To help raise awareness, a group of dedicated folks are engaged in The Great March for Climate Action. They began March 1 in Los Angeles and are walking across the country to Washington, D.C. The marchers will be in Chicago on Sept. 6. More information is online, or look up Chicago Climate March on Facebook.
There will be another important climate march in New York City on Sept. 21. This event, called the People's Climate March, is intended to show the United Nations that there is support for serious action on climate change now. My wife and I have already booked our train tickets, and I expect tens of thousands to be there.
This problem is real, and very important. We cannot wait any longer to act. Please join the local march or the national event to show your support for action now on climate change.

Study: Climate change may be worse than we think

WASHINGTON — Most computer simulations of climate change are underestimating by at least one degree how warm the world will get this century, a new study suggests.
It all comes down to clouds and how much heat they are trapping. According to the study published Thursday in the journal Science, computer model simulations say there is more ice and less liquid water in clouds than a decade of satellite observations show.
The more water and less ice in clouds, the more heat is trapped and less the light is reflected, said study co-author Trude Storelvmo, a Yale atmospheric scientist. She said even though it tens of degrees below freezing, the clouds still have lots of liquid water because they don't have enough particles that helps the water turn to ice crystals.
Because as the climate changes, there will be more clouds with far more liquid, and global warming will be higher than previously thought, Storelvmo said.
How much warming is predicted for the next 80 or so years depends a lot on if society cuts back on carbon dioxide emissions. In the worst case scenario, with no carbon reduction, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sees temperatures rising by about 6.7 degrees by the end of the century and Storelvmo said the liquid cloud factor would add another degree or more on top of that.
While the study is "well-reasoned" and "sobering," there are uncertainties with the satellite observations that raise questions for Chris Bretherton at the University of Washington, who wasn't part of the study. He said if the Yale team is right and there's a bigger cloud feedback, why hasn't warming so far been even higher? That's a legitimate question, Storelvmo said, but computer simulations may also be underestimating the cooling effect of aerosols that mask the warming but are diminishing in the atmosphere.
This is just the latest in a series of studies that have found that mainstream science may be too conservative in estimating the pace and effects of warming, including melting ice sheets in Antarctica.

The study says that's because computer simulations aren't quite getting how much liquid is in clouds and underestimate how much heat is being trapped that way. This is on top of other studies saying science may be underplaying how bad climate change can get.

Rivals believe climate change is real, but their solutions differ

Both candidates for Illinois' 14th Congressional District seat believe mankind is contributing to global climate change — but their solutions differ. For incumbent Democrat Lauren Underwood of Naperville, acknowledging what many scientific experts and politicians have been saying for years about humanity's impact on the planet falls in line with her party's view. For Republican challenger Jim Oberweis of Sugar Grove, that stance breaks from many in the GOP. Underwood and Oberweis talked about climate change and other issues in questionnaires for the Daily Herald and other interviews. 
Scientists with NASA and other organizations have observed that Earth's surface temperature is rising more quickly than expected. As a result, scientists say, significant changes to the environment are occurring. Sea levels are rising, glaciers are shrinking, ice is melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland and on the polar continents, and increased drought and insect infestations are leading to more wildfires. Flooding and coastal erosion have worsened, too, including in the Chicago area. Underwood, who is seeking a second term in the Nov. 3 election, blamed climate change on human activity "and our reliance on fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases." She cited the extreme weather and "unprecedented" flooding that have affected northern Illinois in recent years as examples of its impact. "(It) has caused millions of dollars in damage to businesses, homes, farms and infrastructure," Underwood said. Underwood said farmers in the 14th District can't afford for the nation to ignore climate change. She said they're why she proposed eventually successful legislation that prevents the U.S. Agriculture Department and other federal agencies from removing information about climate change from their websites and official communications. "I believe public policy should be driven by science and data," she said. In the House, Underwood helped secure federal funding to support state and local efforts to plan for public health threats caused by climate change. Underwood also said she supports a bill introduced in the House last year that would, if made law, establish requirements to reduce greenhouse gas pollution and result in an economy that's free of such emissions or offsets them by 2050. "Smart investments in clean energy infrastructure will bring high-quality green jobs to our community and will make northern Illinois a leader in this sector," Underwood said. Oberweis' view on climate change has evolved. When asked about it during his unsuccessful 2014 run for the U.S. Senate, Oberweis said Chicago's arctic winter temperatures called into question research on global warming. He said more evidence was needed "before we destroy the economy with huge regulations." In this campaign, however, Oberweis said he believes climate change is real and that humanity contributes to it. He said "common-sense solutions" are needed. Oberweis called the Green New Deal — an environmental proposal from Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — "far too radical." He supports transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy but noted "it is not something that is going to happen overnight." "We must work toward these goals with the objective of maintaining accessibility to affordable energy," said Oberweis, a dairy owner who has served in the state Senate since 2013. Oberweis said technological innovations are bringing down the cost of renewable energy products and making them increasingly competitive. But the nation isn't yet ready to make the wind and sun the dominant sources of energy, he said. Nuclear energy should be part of the nation's long-term energy solution, Oberweis added.
