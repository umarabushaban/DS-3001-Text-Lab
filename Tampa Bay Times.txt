A viral image circulating on social media ridicules the idea that climate change is to blame for a recent hurricane in Florida, noting the many hurricanes that have hit the Sunshine State over the better part of two centuries.
"Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change," claims the image, which includes a picture of a monkey.
The image was shared in a Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)
The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes what is the consensus view among hurricane researchers. Their message is not that climate change caused recent hurricanes, but that there is evidence that it might have made them more serious.
The post also misstates the number of hurricanes. Brian McNoldy, senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said there have been 140 hurricanes in Florida since 1850.
Vague reference in viral image
The Sept. 8 post was shared by conservative commentator James T. Harris, who has more than 537,000 followers on Facebook. But neither his post nor the viral image cites a particular hurricane.
The post came one day after President Joe Biden walked through a New York City neighborhood devastated by the remnants of Hurricane Ida, where he said, "the evidence is clear. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives."
But the text in the image hascirculatedsince at least September 2017, when Hurricane Irma hit Florida, and some versions of the post insert the word "manmade" before "climate change."
Prior fact-checks
Here's what we found in a fact-check published Sept. 9,  and one from October 2020:
Studies of Atlantic storms since 1980 found that the hurricanes that form there tend to be stronger than in the past. Human-driven climate change might play a role, although the science is unsettled.
The number of hurricanes making landfall in the U.S. each year has not increased since a century ago, but researchers said it's likely that global warming will cause future hurricanes to be more intense.
We asked several hurricane researchers about the claim in the viral image; they agreed that climate change doesn't cause hurricanes, but could make them more severe.
"The way we think about climate change impact on extremes, including hurricanes" is that climate change from human activity "can modify their characteristics," said Suzana Camargo, a research professor at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. For example, the most intense hurricanes occur more often, or the precipitation associated with particular hurricanes increases, she said.
As for climate change's effect specifically on Florida hurricanes, "it is hard to make the assessment on a specific region, as the sample size is small," she said.
Climate change is not the cause of hurricanes, because hurricanes occur naturally, said Kevin Trenberth, distinguished scholar at the National Center of Atmospheric Research. "But climate change alters the ocean and atmosphere environment to make them more active. This can and is manifested in several ways: more intensity, bigger, longer lasting, and perhaps more hurricanes."
Phil Klotzbach, research scientist in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University, said "we don't expect to see more hurricanes in the future due to climate change - in fact we actually see fewer - but the warmer water temperatures may lead to stronger storms in the future."
He added: "These trends may be hard to detect for many years to come, especially for landfalling hurricanes."
Our ruling
A viral image claimed: "Florida has had 119 hurricanes since 1850, but the last one was due to climate change."
The post uses a sarcastic tone to mock what scientists say about climate change and hurricanes, but it mischaracterizes their view.
Experts do not blame climate change for causing hurricanes, though they say it's a possible cause of making them more intense.
The post also misstates the number of hurricanes in Florida since 1850. It has had 140.
We rate the post False.

As extreme weather increases, climate misinformation adapts; Climate denialism isn't the only problem. Misinformation merchants are trying to diminish the impact of climate change on extreme weather events.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. - Climate scientists have warned for years that a warming planet would cause more extreme storms, like the one that walloped Texas in February, knocking out power and leaving millions in a deep freeze.
Yet as the snow fell and the wind howled, some looked for other explanations for the storm and its resulting power outages. The conservative website The Gateway Pundit made the false claim that President Joe Biden's energy policies somehow prevented Texas plants from generating the power the state needed and "led to Texans literally freezing to death."
The next day, the conspiracy theory website Infowars published a similarly untrue story that was shared 70,000 times on Facebook and Twitter. Four days later, U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado, tweeted to her 100,000 followers that Biden's energy policies were "leaving millions of Texans freezing to death."
All those claims were false. In fact, an emergency request granted by the Biden administration gave the state authority to exceed federal environmental limits in order to provide enough power to Texans.
To climate scientists and misinformation researchers, claims like these mark an important shift: Instead of focusing on denialism, climate misinformation is getting local, focused on extreme weather events tied to a changing climate - such the Texas storm or recent wildfires that ravaged California and Australia.
"It just isn't credible to deny climate change or the impacts it's having. People see it with their own two eyes," said Penn State University climate scientist Michael Mann. "So there's a shift in tactics. Now it's softer forms of denial, and efforts to diminish the impacts of climate change."
That evolution is evident online. Media intelligence firm Zignal Labs analyzed millions of social media posts, news stories and other online content and found that overall, conversations about climate change in the past 12 months peaked during high-profile natural disasters, including the Texas storm and the California wildfires. Overall, online mentions of natural disasters and their relationship to climate change also increased by 27 percent, Zignal found.
Surveys also show that extreme weather is changing people's thinking about climate change. According to a 2019 poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, nearly 75 percent of Americans said their opinions about climate change have been influenced by extreme weather in the previous five years.
With about 7 in 10 Americans saying they believe climate change is happening, misinformation has now shifted from denialism to focus on its real world impacts. In some ways, that's a positive, as it demonstrates increased public understanding of the problem. But it also creates new opportunities for those who would spread bogus claims.
"We still see claims that global warming doesn't exist, but we also see misinformation about specific areas - such as the wind turbines in Texas," said Emmanuel Vincent, director of Science Feedback, a global network of scientists based in France who work to debunk inaccurate claims about climate change. "A lot of the misinformation is more subtle."
Those who still dispute a connection to a changing climate are grasping for increasingly far-fetched explanations. Following the Texas storm, for instance, some claimed the snow was fake and wouldn't burn, or that it was the result of weather control technology used by Biden. Recent California wildfires? While experts say dry and hot conditions are to blame, some, including U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, have speculated it might be the work of space lasers.
Such misinformation persists online, despite stated attempts by online platforms to stamp it out. While Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all removed content spreading misinformation about COVID-19 or the recent U.S. election, critics say they've been less aggressive when it comes to climate information.
A spokesman for Facebook said the platform is doing more than ever to connect users with accurate information about climate change. Its Climate Science Information Center, created last year, is now available in 16 countries and nine languages, and has a new section dedicated to dispelling climate change myths.
YouTube, owned by Google, was singled out as a leading source for climate misinformation by the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. In a letter to Google, the committee urged the tech giant to do more to combat falsehoods on its platforms.
In an emailed statement, YouTube acknowledged the challenge of "drawing the lines between misinformation, political speech, legitimate debate, and opinion."
U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Florida, chairwoman of the House climate committee, told the AP in a statement that groups who oppose meaningful responses to climate change - including fossil fuel companies - use misinformation to confuse the public. But she said many people aren't buying it.
"It's becoming harder for polluters and their allies to keep standing in the way of climate solutions, which is why they resort to false and harmful misinformation," she said.
"Most Americans, and particularly young Americans, are demanding their representatives take this crisis seriously."

As the impact of climate change becomes more apparent, misinformation about it is shifting to focus more and more on extreme weather. The storm that walloped Texas in February and last year's wildfires in California both led to a wave of false claims seeking to link the events to energy regulation or politics.

Compare St. Petersburg mayoral candidates Ken Welch and Robert Blackmon on the issues; The Trop. Affordable housing. Climate change. Abortion. Dinner with a historical figure. Here's a side-by-side comparison of the city's mayoral candidates on the Nov. 2 ballot.

ST. PETERSBURG - It's been pretty quiet, but there is an election on Nov. 2.
Voters in St. Petersburg will decide between two candidates for mayor: Robert Blackmon and Ken Welch. It's the first open mayoral race in 2009, and whoever wins will serve a four-year term.Also on the ballot are four City Council races (you can read about those here, here, here and here) and eight questions (read about the first city charter amendment here).
These races are is non-partisan, but votes tend to fall along party lines. Welch is a Democrat and Blackmon is a Republican. Welch has raised and spent twice as much as Blackmon's campaign.
So, who are Welch and Blackmon? And where do they stand on the issues facing St. Petersburg?
The following answers were sourced from several community forums and debates and through questionnaires and interviews with the Tampa Bay Times.
Who is Ken Welch?
Welch, 57, is a five-term Pinellas County Commissioner. He was born and raised in St. Petersburg and is the son of the first Black male St. Petersburg City Council member, David Welch. His family was among those in the Gas Plant neighborhood who were displaced by the construction of Tropicana Field.
Welch graduated from Lakewood High and earned degrees from the University of South Florida St. Petersburg and Florida A&M University. He is married with two daughters. He is the perceived frontrunner in this race as the top vote-getter in the August primary with 39.4 percent. If elected, he would be the city's first Black mayor.
His political action committee, Pelican PAC, has raised $550,881 since 2019. He has endorsements from outgoing mayor Rick Kriseman, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, Tampa mayor Jane Castor, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist (D - St. Petersburg) and five out of eight members on the City Council.
Who is Robert Blackmon?
Blackmon, 32, is a current City Council member for District 1 and was elected for the first time in 2019. He too was born and raised in St. Petersburg, graduating from St. Petersburg High and earning a degree from Florida State University.
Blackmon is single and is a real estate investor. If elected, he would be the city's first millennial mayor. He came in second place in the August primary with 28.3 percent of the vote.
Blackmon is endorsed by former St. Petersburg mayor Rick Baker, Pinellas County Commissioner Kathleen Peters, Florida state Sen. Jeff Brandes (R - St. Petersburg) and Florida House Speaker Chris Sprowls (R - Palm Harbor).
Tropicana Field and the Tampa Bay Rays
The age-old question is back for another mayoral cycle. What to do about the 86 acres of prime downtown St. Petersburg real estate? With the Rays eyeing a spot in Ybor City, flirting with a split season in Montreal and a looming lease expiration date of 2027, it's the biggest question in the race.
Welch has said that the Rays are secondary to making good on promises never fulfilled when residents of the Gas Plant community were displaced. He's focused on jobs and equitable economic development, and he's in favor of a split season and a stadium at the current location or at Al Lang Field - or even in Tampa.
"I'm willing to let them look in Tampa and make a decision," Welch said.
The Rays donated $50,000 to Welch's political action committee, which matches what the team gave mayor Rick Kriseman in his 2017 re-election bid. Asked at a WFLA debate how that donation will not affect his influence, Welch said his priority is jobs and equitable gain for the area. "It has to be a fair deal to the city of St. Pete and the taxpayers," he said.
Calling a split season "crazy," Blackmon wants to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg, a stance that is aligned with the St. Petersburg Area Chamber of Commerce. But he's aware of the "harsh realities" evolving on that site.
"I still hold out hope that we can have a shared stadium with the Rowdies and the Rays on the end of the site," Blackmon said, "I'm losing hope on that."
Affordable housing
Both candidates are on board for increasing density and expanding NTM-1, a housing code for Neighborhood Traditional Mixed Residential. It's an upzoning that allows for more garage apartments, duplexes and smaller dwellings - more affordable housing.
Blackmon wants to institute a city-backed mortgage program. He also wants to revamp vintage built condos for affordable housing, since they'd be cheaper than building new.
Welch touts his experience on the county commission creating the housing trust fund and chairing a homeless policy group. He says he wants to focus on housing for those making $19 an hour and less.
Climate change
Welch says climate change needs to factor into infrastructure and density decisions. He said the City Council already has an integrated sustainability action plan in place, but it needs to be funded and implemented. He says he'd also do an energy assessment of city facilities.
"We're going to listen to the science," Welch said of a climate compact he helped form in Tampa Bay.
Blackmon says "smart, low hanging fruit" like vertical oyster gardens and oyster domes could prolong life of sea walls. He also champions his Science Center project to educate youth about climate change.
In coastal high hazard areas, he voted to increase density to allow for buildings to be storm hardened. Not allowing developers to use that land, Blackmon said, will mean they will look into the city's traditionally Black neighborhoods, leading to "reverse redlining."
Abortion
What happened in Texas could take root in Florida. Texas recently passed a bill banning abortions after six weeks, and Florida's Legislature is now working on its own "heartbeat bill." On a recent Saturday, hundreds participated in a local Bans Off Our Bodies march in St. Petersburg, including Welch.
Welch says it's a personal choice. He says the landmark Roe vs. Wade case "found a balance."
"And there's no reason to just unilaterally overturn that, especially when you're talking about incest and rape," Welch said. "I mean it's just, we've, we've lost all sense of reality and reasonableness."
Blackmon said he doesn't want to speak on things he cannot enforce or enact. But as a City Council member, he does have a say in how the council spends $40 million in stimulus money. The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund is currently seeking $40,000.
Blackmon said he did not know about the Bans off our Bodies rally.
"One way or another, abortion is legal until there's something else," he said.
What about diversity, equity and inclusion?
Both candidates have had controversial past statements surface on social media.
In his 30s, Welch penned an op-ed where he said he was part of the "Christian Right" and interpreted the Bible as "clearly pro-family and pro-life." In 2008, Welch said he shared the values of his conservative church that condemned homosexuality.
"My story is, in 25, 30 years, I've learned a lot," Welch said. "I've become a very strong ally. I am a person of faith but my faith is not based on hatred. It never has been."
In his 20s, Blackmon posted vulgar and disparaging remarks about women, Asians and tenants on Facebook. They referred to women as "bitch" and a 3-year-old as a "slut."
"The past is the past and we need to learn from it all the time," Blackmon said. "I'm not at all trying to make excuses. I own that and I apologize."
Unlike Welch, who was in his 30s writing into the paper and being quoted as a county commissioner, Blackmon said he was "some young idiot writing dumb stuff on the internet."
What historical person would they have dinner with?
The question was asked at a recent League of Women Voters forum hosted at University of South Florida St. Petersburg.
Blackmon chose Ross Perot, because he entered the 1992 U.S. presidential race late. He then took a swipe at Welch for mulling over a run for mayor for years.
Welch went with Jesus Christ, because "he learned to endure all the falsehoods and (Blackmon) just said several falsehoods." Welch said he was previously asked to run and never said that he would.
What's their favorite childhood memory of St. Pete?
For Blackmon, his happiest days were at St. Pete High, making friends and meeting friends of friends. He also enjoyed summer camps at Boyd Hill, Pathfinders, Great Explorations, the St. Petersburg Museum of History and the Science Center.
"Looking back, it was the greatest memories of my life," he said at the WFLA debate. "I learned so much about our environment, our economy, how to make the world a better place and also I got to meet a lot of great people."
Welch remembers learning how to swing an ax in his grandfather's woodyard. "The first time someone gave me a tip, I didn't know what to do," he recalled. He remembers the last year of school segregation at Melrose Elementary. The next year, he was part of the first integrated class at Bay Point.
"Those are friendships that last to this day," he said. "It was folks connecting in ways they hadn't because we were coming out of segregation."

As the Florida Legislature begins to reconvene in Tallahassee to prepare for the upcoming January session, we need our senators and representatives to maintain their focus on resilience and to continue to make advancements that address the biggest existential threat of a generation: climate change. By building on the gains made in the last session, we can produce durable results that will protect our Floridian coastal ecosystems, as well as our blue economy that is driven by a healthy ocean.
Floridians from all walks of life can attest that our ocean and coasts are under assault from a warming, rising sea, and we can see that the threats are growing. Warm water exacerbates hurricanes, Red Tides, blue green algal events and fish kills. The changing climate alters animal behavior and makes fish migration patterns volatile. Rising seas pour water onto our streets, compromise our aging septic systems, inundate stormwater systems and flush saltwater into our fresh groundwater supplies. The threats to natural and human systems are seemingly ever-present, and to us Floridians they are becoming more apparent all the time.
Last session, under the leadership of House Speaker Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, and Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, the Legislature took some of the most meaningful steps in Florida history to making an impact on climate resilience.
SB 1954 created and funded the Resilient Florida Grant Program, directed the creation of a Statewide Flooding and Sea Level Rise Resilience Plan and, notably, created the Florida Flood Hub for Applied Research and Innovation at the University of South Florida College of Marine Science. The creation of the Flood Hub is a laudable achievement and will provide a quintessentially important clearinghouse of information and data on the impacts that the rising sea will have on our state - the modeling that will be produced by the Flood Hub will be invaluable for forecasting floods, floodplain inundation mapping , and assessing economic damage. With the former Chief Science Officer of Florida Tom Frazer at the helm at the College of Marine Science, the Flood Hub is certain to be a resilience science powerhouse.
As Speaker Sprowls enters the last year of his leadership term, I am looking forward to working with him and I encourage him to double down on his important efforts on resilience and flooding, and to continue to pave the way for Florida to be a leader on climate issues.
This can and should include enhancement and perpetuation of the resilience and adaptation components Sprowls has underscored, but it should also be expanded to include mitigation components - there are bold actions that Florida can pioneer that will alleviate a warming ocean and climate, and there is an appetite among Floridians to take these challenges head on. Investments in blue carbon projects, which could include seagrass restoration and protection for example, could help sequester carbon that is contributing to the warming climate while also protecting critical habitat for iconic Floridian species such as manatees that have suffered tragic losses over the past year due to compromised water quality and warming waters.
Making investments in protecting our blue economy now will pay dividends long into the future, and we encourage the Legislature to build a bold legacy for itself and for Florida's ocean environment.

Study: Northwest heat wave impossible without climate change; An international team of 27 scientists calculated that climate change increased chances of the extreme heat occurring by at least 150 times, but likely much more.

The deadly heat wave that roasted the Pacific Northwest and western Canada was virtually impossible without human-caused climate change that added a few extra degrees to the record-smashing temperatures, a new quick scientific analysis found.
An international team of 27 scientists calculated that climate change increased chances of the extreme heat occurring by at least 150 times, but likely much more. 
The study, not yet peer reviewed, said that before the industrial era, the region's late June triple-digit heat was the type that would not have happened in human civilization. And even in today's warming world, it said, the heat was a once-in-a-millennium event.
But that once-in-a-millennium event would likely occur every five to 10 years once the world warms another 1.4 degrees (0.8 degrees Celsius), said Wednesday's study from World Weather Attribution. That much warming could be 40 or 50 years away if carbon pollution continues at its current pace, one study author said.
This type of extreme heat "would go from essentially virtually impossible to relatively commonplace," said study co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton University climate scientist. "That is a huge change."
The study also found that in the Pacific Northwest and Canada climate change was responsible for about 3.6 degrees (2 degrees Celsius) of the heat shock. Those few degrees make a big difference in human health, said study co-author Kristie Ebi, a professor at the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington.
"This study is telling us climate change is killing people," said Ebi, who endured the blistering heat in Seattle. She said it will be many months before a death toll can be calculated from June's blast of heat but it's likely to be hundreds or thousands. "Heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer of Americans."
In Oregon alone, the state medical examiner on Wednesday reported 116 deaths related to the heat wave. 
The team of scientists used a well-established and credible method to search for climate change's role in extreme weather, according to the National Academy of Sciences. They logged observations of what happened and fed them into 21 computer models and ran numerous simulations. They then simulated a world without greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The difference between the two scenarios is the climate change portion. 
"Without climate change this event would not have happened," said study senior author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford.
What made the Northwest heat wave so remarkable is how much hotter it was than old records and what climate models had predicted. Scientists say this hints that some kind of larger climate shift could be in play - and in places that they didn't expect.
"Everybody is really worried about the implications of this event," said study co-author Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a Dutch climate scientist. "This is something that nobody saw coming, that nobody thought possible. And we feel that we do not understand heat waves as well as we thought we did. The big question for many people is: Could this also happen in a lot of places?"
The World Weather Attribution team does these quick analyses, which later get published in peer-reviewed journals. In the past, they have found similar large climate change effects in many heat waves, including ones in Europe and Siberia. But sometimes the team finds climate change wasn't a factor, as they did in a Brazilian drought  and a heat wave in India.
Six outside scientists said the quick study made sense and probably underestimated the extent of climate change's role in the heat wave. 
That's because climate models used in the simulations usually underestimate how climate change alters the jet stream that parks "heat domes" over regions and causes some heat waves, said Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann. 
The models also underestimate how dry soil worsens heat because there is less water to evaporate, which feeds a vicious cycle of drought, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA and the Nature Conservancy.
The study hit home for University of Victoria climate scientist Andrew Weaver, who wasn't part of the research team.
"Victoria, which is known for its mild climate, felt more like Death Valley last week," Weaver said. "I've been in a lot of hot places in the world, and this was the worst I've ever been in.
"But you ain't seen nothing yet," he added. "It's going to get a lot worse."

Climate activist Nakate seeks immediate action from world leaders in Glasgow; Nakate is among 400 activists invited to a three-day Youth4Climate meeting that will draft a document for the U.N.'s 26th Climate Change Conference.

MILAN - Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate said Wednesday that youth delegates meeting in Milan want to see immediate action from leaders at the U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland - not cheap, last-ditch grasps at supporting polluting fuels before getting down to business. 
Nakate is among 400 activists invited to Italy's financial capital for a three-day Youth4Climate meeting that will draft a document for the 26th Climate Change Conference of the Parties, which opens on Oct. 31. 
"If leaders and governments are going to talk about net zeroes or cutting emissions, halving emissions by 2030 or 2040 or 2050, that means it has to start now," Nakate told The Associated Press. 
"It doesn't mean, if we are going to do it by 2030, between now and 2030 let's open a coal power plant, you know, let's frack some gas, or let us construct an oil pipeline. That is not the real climate action that we want,'' she said. ""If you are to go net zero by 2030, it has to start now.''
Although the activists have traveled to Milan from 180 countries, Nakate said many have the feeling that their suggestions for the closing document that will be published Thursday are not welcome. She said the dynamic was "concerning."
"It really feels like everything has been decided for us,'' Nakate, a 24-year-old with a degree in business administration. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg similarly accused the organizers on Tuesday of bringing in "cherry-picked" delegates and pretending to listen.
But she said young people were speaking up, and had created their own working group on fossil fuels. 
"Hopefully it's something they can accept,'' she said.
Nakate gave an emotional opening speech to the gathering on Tuesday, calling out leaders for failing to meet financial pledges and describing the devastating impact of climate change at home in Uganda. While she said she was overwhelmed by the support she has received after her speech, she rejected the media's tendency to dub leaders of the movement. 
"It's how people portray the climate movement,'' Nakate said. "It is not just one face or two faces. It's communities. It is people who are organizing in different countries. I think that is the true face of the climate movement. The people who are standing up for the planet and a better future."
In 2020, Nakate was cropped out of an Associated Press photo at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The AP apologized and acknowledged mistakes in how it initially responded.
Pope Francis on Wednesday praised young environmental activists for challenging global leaders to make good on promises to curb emissions and insisted that political leaders make wise decisions to promote "a culture of responsible sharing."
Francis thanked the activists for their "dreams and good projects" and encouraged them to form an educational alliance to help "rebuild the fabric" of humanity through care for the planet. 
"This vision is capable of challenging the adult world, for it reveals that you are prepared not only for action, but also for patient listening, constructive dialogue and mutual understanding," he said. 
Francis has made care for "our common home" of the Earth a hallmark of his papacy and devoted an entire encyclical to the issue in 2015. The Scottish bishops conference has said it expects Francis to attend the Glasgow climate summit, though the Vatican hasn't yet confirmed his presence. 
"It is time to take wise decisions so that we can make use of the many experiences gained in recent years, in order to make possible a culture of care, a culture of responsible sharing," Francis said in the message.

Here's how climate change could make future Red Tide blooms worse; From warm water to rainfall, there are many ways a changing climate could alter Florida's blooms.

Red Tide blooms have plagued Florida for hundreds of years at least, and scientists say they are not going anywhere.
But could they get worse?
It's certainly possible in a warming world. The first problem is scientists don't know enough now to predict what will happen.
"There's a lot of speculation that climate change is going to impact Red Tides," said Cynthia Heil, director of the Red Tide Institute at Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium.
Researchers are "at the very start" of studying how shifting conditions could affect blooms, Heil said. After years of inconsistent funding, even more immediate questions remain outstanding, like what exactly ends a bloom and what causes Red Tide to vary so much in severity from year to year.
Meanwhile, the region around Tampa Bay has experienced its second devastating bloom since the beginning of 2018.
"It's always: Well, it's complicated," said Don Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. "And that's certainly the story here."
Out of tens of thousands of algae, Anderson said, it's difficult to pinpoint how any one species will respond to a changing climate. The Red Tide that typically devastates the gulf coast near Tampa Bay consists of a microscopic organism called Karenia brevis.
More intense rainfall is one obvious way climate change could affect Red Tide. Blooms feed upon nutrients, especially nitrogen, that get dumped into waterways in excess via runoff from people's fertilizer-coated yards and leaky septic or sewer systems. More rain coming in heavy storms could worsen the runoff problem and supply Red Tide with more nutrients.
"What would have been a natural phenomenon is subject to exacerbation on failure of effective management," said Douglas Rader, chief oceans scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.
Some predictions suggest Florida will see more severe droughts followed by intense deluges in the wet season, said Lisa Krimsky, a water resources specialized agent with Florida Sea Grant.
"Both of those could potentially influence Karenia brevis for the negative to us," she said.
Droughts lower riverlevels, meaning less freshwater flows into bodies like Tampa Bay. The estuary becomes saltier, and this higher salinity can be conducive to Red Tide. A dry winter and spring is thought to be onefactor why a bloom traveled so high up in the bay this year.
Warming ocean temperatures are yet another way conditions could change. But Karenia brevis has shown it thrives in a range of temperatures, researchers said, and slight fluctuations may not have a big effect. Major changes could even make the water so hot that it becomes less hospitable to the algae.
Studies have been inconclusive on whether increases in carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming, will affect Red Tide directly, said Krimsky, of Florida Sea Grant. Carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere when people burn fossil fuels.
Red Tides usually show up off Florida's west coast in the fall, said Rick Stumpf, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He called it "a bit concerning" that 2021 has brought a summertime bloom only three years after the last such Red Tide hit the region.
It is far too early, though, to know whether persistent outbreaks will become common, Stumpf said, or whether that would have a connection to climate change.
"I'm hoping it's just a fluke," Stumpf said. "We're going to look into this. We're going to try to investigate to see if we can sort out any patterns."
These Red Tide theories will take years to vet, and they only contemplate one of multiple harmful algal blooms that trouble Florida. While Red Tide is a bane for the central gulf coast, blue-green algae are a problem elsewhere, particularly Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie, St. Johns and Caloosahatchee rivers.
The cyanobacteria in such blooms proliferate in hot conditions, said Anderson, of Woods Hole.
"There will be winners and losers, and right now the only obvious winners are going to be the freshwater cyanobacteria," he said.
Though the science around Red Tides is less settled, Anderson said, Florida is better positioned than anywhere else to help researchers find answers. The state holds a substantial record of water quality data from past blooms, covering several decades.
"At some point there will be information that can be mined out of that," he said.

How to stay safe near the water
· Do not swim around dead fish.
· Those with chronic respiratory problems should be careful and stay away from places with a Red Tide bloom. Leave if you think Red Tide is affecting you.
· Do not harvest or eat mollusks or distressed and dead fish from the area. Fillets of healthy fish should be rised with clean water, and the guts thrown out.
· Pet owners should keep their animals away from the water and from dead fish.
· Residents living near the beach should close their windows and run air conditioners with proper filters.
· Beachgoers can protect themselves by wearing masks.

Biden, world leaders try to hammer out next steps to combat climate change; The American president announced a new U.S.-European pledge to cut climate-wrecking methane leaks.

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden tried to hammer out the world's next steps against rapidly worsening climate change in a private, virtual session with a small group of other global leaders Friday, and announced a new U.S.-European pledge to cut climate-wrecking methane leaks.
Ever-grimmer findings from scientists this year that the world is nearing the point where the level of climate damage from burning oil, gas and coal becomes catastrophic and irreversible "represent a code red for humanity," Biden said at the session's outset.
"We have to act and we have to act now," Biden said, speaking on a specially erected White House set that showed virtual arrays of solar panels in the background and a wall of other global leaders listening on screens. 
Biden cited his trips earlier this month to California, where firefighters are battling larger, fiercer and deadlier wildfires almost year round as temperatures rise and drought worsens, and to the northeastern U.S. and Gulf, where Hurricane Ida and its flooding killed scores, as natural disasters increase in number and severity under climate change.
As Biden spoke Friday, California firefighters were trying to stop fires from reaching ancient groves of sequoias that are thousands of years old and the height of high-rises. Crews wrapped the trees, including General Sherman, the largest known tree on earth, in aluminum blankets for protection.
Biden evoked the "damage and destruction" he had seen in the United States, massive flooding in Europe and other global damage from the warming climate.
The Biden administration billed Friday's meeting as a chance for some of the world leaders to strategize how to achieve big, fast cuts in climate-wrecking petroleum and coal emissions. The administration also is trying to re-establish the United States' Major Economies Forum - a climate group set up by President Barack Obama and revived by Biden - as a significant forum for international climate negotiations.
Friday's meeting followed a much bigger and splashier virtual White House climate summit in April that saw scores of heads of governments - representing allies and rivals, and big economies and small - making sweeping speeches about the need for action against climate change.
The list provided of Friday's attendees included only a dozen leaders: those of Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, the European Commission, the European Council, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United Nations.
China, India and Russia, with the United States, are the nations that emit the most climate-damaging gases from the production and burning of oil, natural gas and coal. 
There was no word on their leaders' taking part. However, the White House said in a statement that Biden had directed his climate envoy, John Kerry, to lead a minister-level climate session afterwards with China, Germany, India, and Russia. It gave no other immediate details.
Climate advocates have stressed the importance of the U.S. coordinating with Europe and Asia for a joint front in coaxing China, which emits more climate-damaging fumes than the rest of the developed world combined, to move faster on cutting its use of dirty-burning coal-fired power plants in particular.
Biden, in the public opening of the otherwise private talks, also discussed a new U.S. agreement with the European Union aiming at cutting the two entities' emissions of methane 30% by the end of this decade. Methane is one of the most potent agents of climate damage, gushing up by the ton from countless uncapped oil and gas rigs, leaky natural gas pipelines, and other oil and gas facilities.
Fred Krupp, president of the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said cutting methane pollution is the single fastest, most effective strategy to slow the rate of warming.
A 30% reduction in methane pollution should be only "the entry point for this critical conversation. Many countries can and should aim even higher," Krupp said.
The pledge comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is set to propose stricter rules against methane emissions for the oil and gas sector, as laid out in one of Biden's first executive orders. 
The new rules, expected in the next two weeks, are likely to be stricter than an Obama-era standard set in 2016. The Obama standard was reinstated in June after Congress took the unusual step of invalidating a Trump-era EPA rollback of methane protections.
The pending EPA rule is expected to restrict methane emissions from new and existing wells, including hundreds of thousands of older wells that are not subject to federal regulation under current law.
Biden has sought to make the U.S. a leader again in global climate efforts after President Donald Trump removed the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. 
At home, however, Biden is still striving to get significant investment in climate-friendly measures like charging stations for electric vehicles out of Congress, in the face of objections from Republicans and some Democrats.
Friday's session will be followed by another closed-door session of 35 to 40 world leaders, to be hosted Monday morning by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The private sessions are seeking to ensure global leaders come to a November U.N. climate session with commitments of significant new actions to slow climate change. Biden and others bill the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow as a last chance for the world to commit to cutting use of fossil fuels fast enough to stave off the worse scenarios of global warming. 
"We have to bring to Glasgow our highest possible ambitions," Biden said. "Those that have not yet done so, time is running out."

I have been a rancher in Florida for more than six decades. My history is infused with life on the land, as my family has been ranching in Florida since the 19th century. The cattle we raise provide for families across the nation, and I am proud of that. I also take pride that Florida ranches provide habitat for Florida's native wildlife and protects a landscape that stores and cleans water naturally. Our ranches also act as buffers against future climate change impacts; for instance, they provide grasslands that can help store carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The benefits that ranches provide - protecting water, wildlife and addressing climate change impacts - are called ecosystem services. The Growing Climate Solutions Act will allow farmers, ranchers and foresters to receive needed incentives to provide these ecosystems services.
Florida's agricultural sector contributes more than $120 billion to the state's economic revenue. Our 47,000 commercial farms and ranches feed people across the country and provide jobs to thousands of Floridians. To maintain our livelihoods in the face of a changing climate, we have to be nimble, finding ways to adapt to climate impacts and work more sustainably. Without action, we've got a lot to lose. Storms threaten crop yields; changing rainfall patterns can dry up our lands or flood our fields; higher temperatures can require more irrigation.
Florida ranches are also in danger of being lost as Florida grows by about 300,000 people a year. This growth results in the conversion of thousands of acres of ranches every year. Once these ranchlands are gone, we forever lose the ecosystem services they provide
Besides having a lot to lose, we have a lot to offer. Florida's working lands, and the people who steward them, are vital in the fight against the causes of climate change. Ranchers are committed to protecting Florida's wildlife and water while also helping to address climate change. Many ranchers are working with partners, such as non-governmental conservation organizations, the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, state and federal governments and others, to make ranching more ecologically sustainable and sequester carbon in both wetland soils and grasslands.
The Growing Climate Solutions Act, now introduced in the United States Senate, provides opportunities for farmers and ranchers to access carbon markets, helping them improve and monetize the ecosystem services their lands provide. Additionally, it creates a program that will assist landowners in implementing sustainable practices, like planting cover crops, prescribed grazing, and reforestation, that reduce air pollution and sequester carbon. Implementing new techniques and practices will be a learning curve; the Growing Climate Solutions Act recognizes that, with the right tools, the agricultural and forestry sectors can be innovative partners in climate mitigation.
For too long, ranching has been pigeonholed as a barrier to a clean and sustainable environment. Ranchers want to provide climate solutions and make our state more resilient. And we can.
I urge Sen. Marco Rubio to co-sponsor the Growing Climate Solutions Act. Florida has been a leader on climate resilience and restoration. With his support, Florida's farmers and ranchers can continue to be leaders in our collective efforts to combat the effects of climate change.
Jim Strickland is the owner of Strickland Ranch and managing partner of Big Red Cattle Company and Blackbeard's Ranch. He is co-chairman of the Florida Climate Smart Agriculture Work Group, sponsored by the University of Florida and Solutions from the Land, and vice chairman of the Florida Conservation Group, an organization that advocates for the protection of Florida's ranchlands.

What's next for climate change in Florida Legislature?; Even after losing a key leader, advocates wonder if lawmakers are ready to act.

The day after Floridians took to voting booths, the same day the United States officially left a global agreement to reduce planet-warming emissions, Miami state Sen. José Javier Rodríguez was gearing up for a recount he would lose.
Rodríguez had become known in Tallahassee for wearing galoshes around the Capitol. It was an attempt, he said, to make his colleagues pay attention to sea level rise after years of inaction. His narrow defeat, in a race clouded by a no-party candidate with the same last name (who may have lived in a different district), was not a clear referendum on Rodríguez's politics.
But it left the Legislature of a state perhaps more vulnerable than most to climate change without a clear champion on the issue. The question now is whether Florida needs that kind of figure, or whether it has reached a point where the topic no longer requires a man slipping on rain boots to prompt discussion in the halls of power.
"It is a worrying message in terms of what it says about climate policy," said Rodríguez, a Democrat, talking also about the state's backing of President Donald Trump, who has doubted the science of climate change. The loss belied his experience on the campaign trail, where he said voters asked about the subject more than ever. Floridians, too, backed some local green measures; residents of Key Biscayne approved a $100 million bond to address sea level rise.
"My hope is that maybe there's a disconnect on policy and politics," Rodríguez said, "that people weren't intending to vote against the climate agenda."
Surveys show most Floridians accept the realities of climate change and worry about the impacts. A shift in the electorate, advocates say, has led to a gradual thaw on conversations about the problem in Tallahassee.The altered tone follows a decade of avoidance by Republican leadership, they say, though lawmakers still shy away from talking seriously about emissions that contribute to climate change.
Incoming House Speaker Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, and Senate President Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, wrote earlier this year about the need to improve flood defenses. After multiple failed attempts, Rodríguez last year joined with Rep. Vance Aloupis, a Miami Republican, to pass a law that requires sea level rise studies before certain state-funded construction.
"The state has a responsibility to address these issues," Aloupis said. Parts of his district flood even in regular storms. "It's never good to be reliant upon one person. It needs to be something that's an ongoing conversation."
Florida voters and climate
Some progressives thought Florida might swing on the climate vote in 2020.
It did not.
The Sierra Club Florida tallied 21 House wins - and 36 losses - for candidates friendly to its cause across the primary and general election, said Deborah Foote, the group's government affairs and political director. In the Senate, she said, they managed an even record.
"The brighter light is shining on those local races where we are seeing a significant number of our endorsed candidates winning," Foote said shortly after the election. "I think that's where we're going to see continued change and innovation, on the local level."
Florida Conservation Voters celebrated candidates securing spots on the Coral Springs City Commission and in the Miami-Dade mayor's office, said the group's executive director, Aliki Moncrief. Both victories came, unsurprisingly, in South Florida, which has long outpaced the rest of the state both in experiencing the most obvious effects of climate change and in trying to address them.
Voters in national and statewide races undoubtedly had other issues that were a priority this year: the pandemic, a sputtering economy and racial injustice.
Some still view the environment as more of a backyard, local concern, Foote said. Residents on bothcoastsagreed to pay additional taxes to boost conservation. In Orange County, they decided to recognize natural bodies like rivers and streams in court cases, part of an environmental movement called Rights of Nature that advocates say could make it easier to bring lawsuits to block pollution and development. Lawmakers recently passed a bill that would make such a rule illegal in Florida, arguing that the idea could produce frivolous legal challenges.
Altogether, Foote and Moncrief said, the mixed results may foretell more of the same, with municipalities running ahead of Tallahassee on climate issues.
Though lawmakers have begun to openly discuss the damage rising seas could cause, Moncrief said, they have stalled on attempts to address the human sources of warming.
"I do not think we're going to see that coming out of the Legislature," she said.
Others see a real opportunity in new leadership, particularly with Sprowls atop the House of Representatives. In a speech last year, he said: "We need to stop being afraid of words like 'climate change' and 'sea level rise.'" The op-ed he wrote with Simpson, published in the Tampa Bay Times, referred to "sea level rise" but did not use the term "climate change."
Neither Sprowls nor Simpson, the Senate President, responded to a call or text message seeking comment for this story.
"We have crossed a threshold when it comes to sea level rise and flooding and the need for resilience," said Susan Glickman, Florida leader of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. "But if all we do is adapt to sea level rise ... there's an old adage: When you find yourself in a hole, what do you do? You stop digging."
Is Tallahassee changing?
Depending on who's talking, the last Florida legislative session was either a reason for optimism or for continued skepticism.
Rodríguez and Aloupis earned unanimous support for the sea level rise study law, but other climate-related bills flopped. Rodríguez had hoped to push the state Department of Health to develop an annual report about concerns like water quality, heat-related sickness and the spread of diseases under a changing climate. He couldn't find a partner to pick it up in the House.
"There's a danger in dealing with climate only as it impacts property and economics," Rodríguez said.
Florida is one of 13 states to not have some kind of specific goals or standards for how much energy comes from renewable sources like solar power,according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A law last year, introduced by Rodríguez and Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, would have targeted 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, but it did not get a vote.
"I think the hill just got steeper," Rodríguez said. Many lawmakers, he said, are swayed by utility companies that rely on natural gas to make power.
Rep. Ben Diamond, a St. Petersburg Democrat talked about as a person who could help carry the mantle on climate change, introduced a bill last winter that would have made the state formulate a resiliency plan to present to the governor. It was not brought up for a vote. Another early advocate for addressing climate change, Rep. Kristin Jacobs, D-Coconut Creek,died this year of cancer.
"I can't really predict how far we get in one session, but just the fact that we're now having these conversations and we're having them in a bipartisan and constructive way I think is positive," Diamond said. "Now we need to take some action to go along with it."
Aloupis said he will continue to suggest flood mitigation policies, but he believes lawmakers have to consider the sources of climate change, too. Local governments, he said, need state help to make fixes in stormwater systems and to convert areas, including in his own district, from septic systems to newer sewer lines. Most of all, they need money.
"This is going to have to be not just looked at from a policy perspective but from an appropriations perspective," Aloupis said.
When lawmakers return next March, they will confront a host of budget problems as the pandemic has throttled state revenues. Glickman noted hopefully, though, that a House subcommittee on environment and agriculture has added "flooding" to its title.
"You can only ignore some problems for so long," she said.
With little earlier progress, Rodríguez said, "the biggest challenge is the bar is so low."
"There's going to be relatively small policies that then get sold as if they're really championing the kind of planning and forward-looking policies that we need here," he said. "How much of an incentive is there to really tackle climate or is this about scoring political points with the general electorate?"

Florida environmentalists want Legislature to create climate change committee; The request from Florida Conservation Voters comes in a letter to top lawmakers, both from Tampa Bay.

As two Tampa Bay leaders take control of the Florida Legislature, a group of environmental advocates is asking them to create a committee on climate change to tackle what it considers "the single biggest threat facing Florida."
In a letter Tuesday, Florida Conservation Voters executive director Aliki Moncrief asked Rep. Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor, the new House Speaker, and Sen. Wilton Simpson, R-Trilby, the new Senate President, to select a group of lawmakers from both chambers to focus on the issue.
"We believe that the climate change crisis facing Florida warrants, at a minimum, a serious and deliberative body to explore and propose policy solutions to address the worst effects of this unfolding disaster and enact policies that will solve the problem at its source," Moncrief wrote, citing language from the Florida Constitution that says the state should manage pollution and protect natural resources.
Neither Sprowls nor Simpson answered a call or immediately replied to a text message seeking comment Tuesday.
The letter references issues like saltwater intrusion into the freshwater supply, higher temperatures and increased flooding as ripe for a potential committee to study. Moncrief noted that rising tides could cut into property values on the coast and drive people to higher ground, where they may displace low- and middle-income Black and Latino communities.
For the better part of the last decade, state lawmakers have passed few bills and entertained few serious public discussions about climate change. Policy creation has meanwhile advanced within cities and groups like the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact and Tampa Bay Regional Resiliency Coalition.
"Local communities are making incredible efforts to combat the threat," Moncrief wrote. "Now, state leaders must also explore and enact policies to address both the most harmful effects and the root causes of climate change."
Under Gov. Ron DeSantis, state officials have begun to talk about climate change more openly, but environmentalists say Florida remains focused on adaptation - building up roads, seawalls and houses - rather than lowering emissions from cars and energy producers that worsen global warming.
Sprowls and Simpson, in a September letter to the Tampa Bay Times, wrote that the Legislature can do "quite a bit" to address sea level rise.
"Rising water damages homes, disrupts businesses, and displaces families and employees, which leads to, among other significant impacts, increases in insurance premiums for all Floridians," they wrote. They did not use the term climate change but said with all of its coastline and developed wetlands, Florida is "particularly vulnerable."
The two lawmakers touted a grant program that has provided funding for local resiliency projects and described a path that includes making flood mitigation an important part of infrastructure planning, drawing down federal funds to expand that work and collaborating with cities and counties that have already started to work on climate adaptation. Sprowls reiterated his intention to pursue flood mitigation in his first official address as speaker on Tuesday.
Florida Conservation Voters' letter marks the second time the environmental advocacy organization says it has asked top lawmakers for a climate change committee.
Times staff writer Kirby Wilson contributed to this report.

World leaders pledge climate cooperation despite other rifts; Biden's new U.S. commitment, timed to the summit, would cut America's fossil fuel emissions as much as 52% by 2030.

WASHINGTON - The leaders of Russia and China put aside their raw-worded disputes with U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday long enough to pledge international cooperation on cutting climate-wrecking coal and petroleum emissions in a livestreamed summit showcasing America's return to the fight against global warming.
Neither Vladimir Putin nor Xi Jinping immediately followed the United States and some of its developed allies in making specific new pledges to reduce damaging fossil fuel pollution during the first day of the two-day U.S.-hosted summit. But climate advocates hoped the high-profile - if glitch-ridden - virtual gathering would kickstart new action by major polluters, paving the way for a November U.N. meeting in Glasgow critical to drastically slowing climate change over the coming decade.
The entire world faces "a moment of peril" but also "a moment of opportunity," Biden declared, speaking from a TV-style chrome-blue set for the virtual summit of 40 world leaders. Participants appeared one after the other onscreen for what appeared to be a mix of live and recorded addresses. 
"The signs are unmistakable," Biden said. "The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction keeps mounting."
Biden's new U.S. commitment, timed to the summit, would cut America's fossil fuel emissions as much as 52% by 2030. It comes after four years of international withdrawal from the issue under President Donald Trump, who mocked the science of climate change and pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord.
Biden's administration this week is sketching out a vision of a prosperous, clean-energy United States where factories churn out cutting-edge batteries and electric cars for export, line workers re-lay an efficient national electrical grid and crews cap abandoned oil and gas rigs and coal mines.
But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the administration's plans as costly and ineffective. 
"This is quite the one-two punch," McConnell said in a Senate speech Thursday. "Toothless requests of our foreign adversaries ... and maximum pain for American citizens."
At the summit, Japan announced its own new 46% emissions reduction target and South Korea said it would stop public financing of new coal-fired power plants, potentially an important step toward persuading China and other coal-reliant nations to curb building and funding of new ones as well.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, one of the leaders shown watching summit proceedings in the coronavirus pandemic's familiar Brady Bunch-style multibox conference screen, said his nation would up its fossil fuel pollution cuts from 30% to at least 40%.
Travel precautions under the pandemic compelled the summit to play out on livestream, limiting opportunities for spontaneous interaction and negotiation. Its opening hours were sometimes marked by electronic echoes, random beeps and off-screen voices.
But the summit also marshaled an impressive display of the world's most powerful leaders speaking on the single cause of climate change. 
China's Xi, whose country is the world's biggest emissions culprit, followed by the United States, spoke first among the other global figures. He made no reference to disputes over territorial claims, trade and other matters that had made it uncertain until Wednesday that he would even take part in the U.S. summit. And he said China would work with America in cutting emissions.
"To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to boost the environment is to boost productivity. It's as simple as that," Xi said.
Putin and his government have been irate over Biden's characterization of him as a "killer" for Russia's aggressive moves against its opponents, and he is under pressure this week over the declining health of jailed opposition figure Alexei Navalny. But he made no mention of those disputes in his own climate remarks.
"Russia is genuinely interested in galvanizing international cooperation so as to look further for effective solutions to climate change as well as to all other vital challenges," Putin said. Russia by some measures is the world's fourth-biggest emitter of climate-damaging fossil fuel fumes.
Climate efforts in recent years have proved a forum where even rival world leaders want to be seen as putting aside disputes to serve as international statesmen and women, even though the cumulative output of fossil fuel emissions is still hurtling the Earth toward disastrous temperature rises.
The pandemic made gathering world leaders for the climate summit too risky. So Biden's staff built a small set in the East Room that looked like it was taken from a daytime talk show.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris joined Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House climate envoy John Kerry at a horseshoe-shaped table set up around a giant potted plant to watch fellow leaders' speeches. 
The format meant a cavalcade of short speeches by world leaders, some scripted, some not. "This is not bunny-hugging," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of the climate efforts. "This is about growth and jobs."
The Biden administration's pledge would require by far the most ambitious U.S. climate effort ever, nearly doubling the reductions that the Obama administration had committed to in the Paris climate accord.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was one of many allies welcoming the U.S. return after Trump..
"I'm delighted to see that the United States is back, is back to work together with us in climate politics," Merkel declared in her virtual appearance. "Because there can be no doubt about the world needing your contribution if we really want to fulfill our ambitious goals."
Pope Francis contributed a video from the Vatican, saying, "I wish you success in this beautiful decision to meet, walk together going forward and I am with you all the way."
The new urgency comes as scientists say that climate change caused by coal plants, car engines and other fossil fuel use is worsening droughts, floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters and that humans are running out of time to stave off catastrophic extremes of global warming.
Leaders of smaller states and island nations buffeted by rising seas and worsening hurricanes appealed for aid and fast emissions cuts from world powers.
"We are the least contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, but the most affected by climate change," said Gaston Alfonso Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda. He called for debt relief and more international assistance to recover from storms and the pandemic to prevent a flow of climate refugees. His people he said, are "teetering on the edge of despair."
Longtime climate policy experts, no strangers to climate summits with solemn pledges, watched some speeches with skepticism. After Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro promised an end to clearcutting in the Amazon, Dan Wilkinson of Human Rights Watch's environmental programs noted, "It is going to be hard for anyone to take it seriously until they actually start taking steps."

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden is set to announce a wide-ranging moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on U.S. lands, as his administration moves quickly to reverse Trump administration policies on energy and the environment and address climate change.
Two people with knowledge of Biden's plans outlined the proposed moratorium, which will be announced Wednesday. They asked not to be identified because the plan has not been made been public; some details remain in flux. 
The move follows a 60-day suspension of new drilling permits for U.S. lands and waters announced last week and follows Biden's campaign pledge to halt new drilling on federal lands and end the leasing of publicly owned energy reserves as part of his plan to address climate change. The moratorium is intended to allow time for officials to review the impact of oil and gas drilling on the environment and climate.
Environmental groups hailed the expected moratorium as the kind of bold, urgent action needed to slow climate change.
"The fossil fuel industry has inflicted tremendous damage on the planet. The administration's review, if done correctly, will show that filthy fracking and drilling must end for good, everywhere,'' said Kierán Suckling, executive director at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has pushed for the drilling pause.
Oil industry groups slammed the move, saying Biden had already eliminated thousands of oil and gas jobs by killing the Keystone XL oil pipeline on his first day in office.
"This is just the start. It will get worse,'' said Brook Simmons, president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma. "Meanwhile, the laws of physics, chemistry and supply and demand remain in effect. Oil and natural gas prices are going up, and so will home heating bills, consumer prices and fuel costs.''
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas drillers in Western states, said the expected executive order is intended to delay drilling on federal lands to the point where it is no longer viable.
"The environmental left is leading the agenda at the White House when it comes to energy and environment issues,'' she said, noting that the moratorium would be felt most acutely in Western states such as Utah, Wyoming and North Dakota. Biden lost all three states to former President Donald Trump.
The drilling moratorium is among several climate-related actions Biden will announce Wednesday. He also is likely to direct officials to conserve 30% of the country's lands and ocean waters in the next 10 years, initiate a series of regulatory actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and issue a memorandum that elevates climate change to a national security priority. He also is expected to direct all U.S. agencies to use science and evidence-based decision-making in federal rule-making and announce a U.S.-hosted climate leaders summit on Earth Day, April 22.
The conservation plan would set aside millions of acres for recreation, wildlife and climate efforts by 2030, part of Biden's campaign pledge for a $2 trillion program to slow global warming.
Under Trump, federal agencies prioritized energy development and eased environmental rules to speed up drilling permits as part of the Republican's goal to boost fossil fuel production. Trump consistently downplayed the dangers of climate change, which Biden, a Democrat, has made a top priority. 
On his first day in office last Wednesday, Biden signed a series of executive orders that underscored his different approach - rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, revoking approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada and telling agencies to immediately review dozens of Trump-era rules on science, the environment and public health.
A 60-day suspension order at the Interior Department did not limit existing oil and gas operations under valid leases, meaning activity would not come to a sudden halt on the millions of acres of lands in the West and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico where much drilling is concentrated. The moratorium also is unlikely to affect existing leases. Its effect could be further blunted by companies that stockpiled enough drilling permits in Trump's final months to allow them to keep pumping oil and gas for years.
The pause in drilling is limited to federal lands and does not affect drilling on private lands, which is largely regulated by states.
Oil and gas extracted from public lands and waters account for about a quarter of annual U.S. production. Extracting and burning those fuels generates the equivalent of almost 550 million tons (500 million metric tons) of greenhouse gases annually, the U.S. Geological Survey said in a 2018 study.
Under Trump, Interior officials approved almost 1,400 permits on federal lands, primarily in Wyoming and New Mexico, over a three-month period that included the election, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data. Those permits, which remain valid, will allow companies to continue drilling for years, potentially undercutting Biden's climate agenda.

Congress takes aim at climate change in massive relief bill; The energy and climate provisions, supported by lawmakers from both parties, were hailed as the most significant climate change law in at least a decade.

WASHINGTON - The huge pandemic relief and spending bill includes billions of dollars to promote clean energy such as wind and solar power while sharply reducing over time the use of potent coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators that are considered a major driver of global warming.
The energy and climate provisions, supported by lawmakers from both parties, were hailed as the most significant climate change law in at least a decade.
"Republicans and Democrats are working together to protect the environment through innovation," said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
"This historic agreement includes three separate pieces of legislation that will significantly reduce greenhouse gases,'' Barrasso said, citing measures that promote technologies to "capture" and store carbon dioxide produced by power and manufacturing plants; reduce diesel emissions in buses and other vehicles; and authorize a 15-year reduction of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are used in everything from cars to air conditioners. HFCs are considered a major driver of global warming and are being targeted worldwide.
"All three of these measures will protect our air while keeping costs down for the American people,'' Barrasso said. 
The sprawling legislation also extends tax credits for solar and wind power that are a key part of President-elect Joe Biden's ambitious plan to generate 100 percent "clean electricity" by 2035. 
Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the environment panel, said the bill would cut pollution from school buses, air conditioners, refrigerators and more, while creating thousands of American jobs and helping "save our planet from the climate crisis.''
"Make no mistake,'' he said, the new legislation "will soon be some of the most significant climate solutions to pass out of Congress to date.'' 
The bill won praise across the political spectrum, as environmental groups and major business organizations hailed an agreement years in the making.
"While much more remains to be done'' to address climate change, the bipartisan agreement "ramps up clean-energy research and development programs, bolsters energy efficiency, reauthorizes a critical EPA program to reduce diesel pollution, advances a new DOE program to transition to electric school buses ... and rebukes (President Donald) Trump's last attempts to slash environmental programs across the board," said Matthew Davis, legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters.
Marty Durbin, a senior vice president at the Chamber of Commerce, called the package - the first major energy bill in more than a decade - "truly historic" and among the most significant action Congress has ever taken to address climate change.
"This package demonstrates the progress that is possible when businesses, environmental groups, labor and policymakers work together to find solutions on difficult issues,'' Durbin said. The bill will not only address climate change, but also "promote American technological leadership and foster continued economic growth,'' Durbin said.
The dramatic if gradual reduction of HFCs in particular "will bring significant climate relief relatively quickly,'' said Matt Casale, director of environment campaigns for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. He called the bill "a step forward" in a range of areas that will serve as a building block for the incoming Biden administration.
Much of the sweeping energy package - long promoted as a "down payment" on fighting climate change - was agreed to earlier this year, but the package fell apart in March over a dispute among Senate Republicans on the HFC provision.
Carper and Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., pushed for a measure they said would give U.S. companies the certainty needed to produce "next generation" coolants as an alternative to HFCs. Both men represent states that are home to companies that produce the alternative refrigerants.
The Kennedy-Carper amendment was supported by dozens of senators, including 17 Republican co-sponsors. But the amendment was opposed by Senate GOP leadership, including Barrasso and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
Barrasso said he worried the measure could add a layer of new federal rules onto a patchwork of current or future state rules regarding HFCs. He pushed for language ensuring that states would not impose stricter requirements than the federal rule. In the end, lawmakers agreed to prevent state and local governments from regulating HFCs for at least five years.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said the energy package "will foster innovation across the board on a range of technologies that are critical to our energy and national security, our long-term economic competitiveness and the protection of our environment.''
In a separate development, the bill also includes nearly $10 billion to reauthorize the Water Resources Development Act to pay for flood control, environmental restoration, coastal protection, harbor improvements and other projects.

Florida can protect reefs and jobs with support of infrastructure bill | Column; Updating the state's sewer lines will help protect coral reefs.

The $3 trillion infrastructure bill recently announced by President Joe Biden, and set to be released this week, presents exciting opportunities for Floridians on both sides of the aisle. The link is coral reefs.
Florida's barrier reef - the third largest barrier reef in the world - buffers South Florida cities from hurricanes and contributes 70,400 jobs to the state. However, reefs are in a precipitous decline from the dual threats of climate change (long-term impacts from increased carbon in the atmosphere) and pollution (in this case, quick, but lasting impacts from sewage runoff).
In the long term, addressing climate change is the only way to save coral reefs and, by extension, the cities and jobs that rely on them. Warming ocean temperatures from climate change essentially starve coral to death. In the past, climate action has garnered wide and bipartisan support in Florida. Seventy-one percent of Floridians are in favor of government action on climate change. As proposed, the Biden infrastructure bill would make significant progress in the fight against climate change by expanding electric car infrastructure, deploying more clean energy and increasing the number of energy efficient homes.
In the short-term, minimizing coral exposure to extraneous stressors is the best way to buy coral time until we can curb carbon emissions and slow climate change. A recent study found that coral survived warming temperatures when local pollution was absent, which shows that reducing local stress doesbuy coral time in the face of climate change. The future for Florida reefs is therefore bright if we can minimize local stress.
A significant source of coral stress is sewage. For instance, beginning in the 1980s, more than 90 percent of elkhorn and staghorn corals died from a disease outbreak linked to untreated human waste entering coastal Florida waters. Unfortunately, sewage leaks are common. In late 2019, 230 million gallons of sewage spilled into Fort Lauderdale waters, and spills are expected to increase in frequency as pipes continue to age. However, it does not have to be this way. Florida sewage lines could be updated using funds from Biden's plan. Roughly a third of the bill plan contributes to infrastructure improvements, including updates to water and sewer lines.
The continued existence of the iconic Florida reef ecosystem is tied to the climate action and infrastructure updates proposed in the Biden infrastructure bill. The same could be written for other charismatic Floridian ecosystems like mangrove forests and the Everglades. Intricately tied to ecosystem health in Florida is economic health.
Biden's infrastructure bill would therefore have multisectoral benefits and attract strong bipartisan support. Floridians on both sides of the aisle have a long history of supporting climate action and have an opportunity to continue leading the nation by calling Florida representatives to the U.S. House and Senate and urging that expansive climate and infrastructure funding remain in the proposed bill.
Katie Ebinger is a master's student of environmental policy at the Yale School of the Environment. She has lived in the Florida Keys researching coral resilience to climate change.
