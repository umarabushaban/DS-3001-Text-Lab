Climate changing for oil, gas industry

Speaking at an oil and gas conference in Santa Fe last week, a panel of state lawmakers expressed sympathy and appreciation for fossil fuel producers, but they also conveyed New Mexico's political landscape was changing and the industry must adapt.
A clear signal of that change was when state Reps. Patty Lundstrom, D-Gallup, and Kelly Fajardo, R-Los Lunas, offered lobbying advice.
Both women emphasized the importance of bringing a concise and coherent request to lawmakers and their staffers, who all are unpaid and have limited time to respond to a hodgepodge of questions and concerns.
The state has a long history of not paying its legislators who, in turn, often are understaffed. What's different is an industry that has been so highly esteemed because of the massive revenue it provides the state now having to improve its lobbying efforts.
"Absolutely. I would say so, yes," Lundstrom said of the trend during a phone interview.
Many newer lawmakers are younger, care more about climate change and are better informed about it, which means they'll ask tougher questions, Lundstrom said. "They're not willing to say, 'Give 'em a pass.' "
This reflects the unfamiliar territory the industry finds itself in as the changing climate causes an extended drought, lower river flows and shortened growing seasons, prompting environmentalists to push for reduced greenhouse gas emissions and voters to make climate a higher priority when electing political leaders.
Industry officials acknowledge a need to curb the release of methane - a potent greenhouse gas - and other toxic chemicals. They also agree a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is inevitable, but they believe the change should be gradual and take many years, even decades.
In the foreseeable future, oil and gas will remain in high demand and continue to be an important part of New Mexico's economy while the industry works to become cleaner to counter climate change, said Leland Gould, interim executive director of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association.
"There's no doubt that the future of our industry is lower carbon and lower emissions," Gould said. "But I know our members in New Mexico can play a big role in meeting the growing demands all over the world and continue to lower emissions."
One environmental advocate said conservationists are taking advantage of the current political climate to push harder for stronger protections for the climate and public health.
"I think there is a moment right now where these climate and clean air issues are coming to the fore," said Jon Goldstein, state policy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. "It has a lot to do with the public at large's understanding of just how serious these problems are becoming."
Increased regulation
and production
State, federal and international reports forecasting the impacts of climate change are alarming. The consensus among climate scientists is that greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere, must be slashed to head off the most disastrous effects.
The dire predictions have led to environmental advocates pressing for swifter measures such as government funding for renewable energy systems, incentives for switching to electric vehicles and more stringent rules on oil and gas operations.
A new generation of lawmakers at both the state and federal levels espouse everything from the Green New Deal to anti-fracking bills to carbon-cutting goals.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2019 calling for the state to cut greenhouse gases by 45 percent by 2030.
In March, the state adopted methane regulations that restrict venting and flaring of natural gas to emergencies. Operators also are required to capture 98 percent of their methane by the end of 2026.
Meanwhile, the state Environment Department is proposing new rules for the fossil fuel industry to curtail ground-level ozone, a toxic gas that can cause respiratory problems. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce tougher methane rules in the coming weeks.
Gould said in the past two decades the industry has constantly faced new regulations, and this is just the latest.
His association has worked with state regulators on rules that reduce methane and ozone emissions but aren't too cumbersome, he said. At the same time, the group works to shore up the industry, which puts about $2.8 billion a year into the state's budget.
"I believe New Mexico is capable of doing both," Gould said. "It is not an either-or."
Many of the association's oil and gas producers have outlined plans to decrease carbon emissions and develop new technologies that are more efficient and less polluting, he said.
The public should know petroleum production is cleaner and more environmentally sound than it has ever been, he said. "And progress continues on that every day."
Five years ago, during a market slump, New Mexico's oil production fell to 150 million barrels a year and has since rebounded to more than 370 million - a record output that puts the state second only to Texas, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.
"The remarkable growth we have seen in that time has enabled an unprecedented economic expansion for the state," New Mexico Oil and Gas Association spokesman Robert McEntyre said. "We think that's something we should take advantage of as we move into the low carbon future."
The industry enjoyed more relaxed oversight under Republican Gov. Susana Martinez, who cut regulatory agencies' budgets and staffing.
Is the industry waiting for the next Republican governor to roll back Lujan Grisham's more stringent regulations?
McEntyre said that's not the plan.
The group has worked with both political parties throughout its history with the aim of establishing reasonable, flexible regulations, he said.
"However, we fundamentally disagree with extreme approaches and rhetoric some groups employ to influence policy," McEntyre said. "It has been difficult to find common ground with those who oppose our existence altogether or advocate for policies that would effectively dismantle oil and natural gas in New Mexico."
Goldstein said it's simplistic to cast activists as extremists for seeking more stringent regulations and a swifter transition to greener energy than the industry desires.
"Whenever you paint with as broad a brush as that, you're going to gloss over a lot of differences of opinion," Goldstein said.
Long, slow transition
During last week's conference, a panel member, Republican state Sen. Steven Neville of Aztec, noted the U.S. has more than 270 million vehicles, and almost all of them use traditional fuels.
"I don't see the oil and gas industry going away in the next 10 years," Neville said. "That's what some of our environmental friends in the Legislature are trying to propose. That's not going to happen. Those cars and trucks and so forth are going to last a lot longer than 10 years."
A Saudi Arabian study projects an increase in oil demand in the next 15 years, he said.
An economist said the sheer number of gas-powered vehicles combined with the state's record-level production and rising oil prices are creating a healthy short-term outlook.
"In the short run, things look pretty good for the industry," said Jim Peach, a New Mexico State University economics professor emeritus.
But major manufacturers such as GM, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota are ramping up production of electric cars, Peach said. "In a few years, that's going to affect demand."
Peach said he's not surprised some industry leaders are grumbling about tougher regulations and feeling under attack.
They felt under siege 20 years ago when the state began requiring operators to line the pits that hold contaminated wastewater to keep them from leaking into the ground, he said. Some operators threatened to move to Texas, but they didn't, he added.
State Sen. George Muñoz, D-Gallup, said more liberal, forward-thinking Democrats have unseated some of the entrenched old guard. These younger progressives are stauncher about environmental oversight, which is good until they overlook the costs, he said.
"I think it's changed for the better," said Muñoz, who also sat on the conference panel. "I'm all for leaving the world a better place. While I agree with a lot of their stuff, when you struggle to fund stuff, it becomes an issue."
These lawmakers need to be practical and consider how much New Mexico still depends on oil and gas revenues and federal funding, Muñoz said. He noted long-term planning is required to even partially phase out such an embedded industry.
Lundstrom said too much focus is put on oil and gas when discussing energy transition, but entire supply chains will have to change if the state shifts to a different energy source.
For instance, hydrogen-powered cars will need completely different engines and infrastructure, and workers will need new skill sets to repair them.
Lujan Grisham discussed a plan at the oil and gas conference to jump-start production of hydrogen fuel, which emits less carbon dioxide than fossil fuels. The selling point to executives was that natural gas - which they could supply - would be used to separate the hydrogen from water.
Gould said in the interview he needs to know more about the specifics of the plan, but he thinks natural gas is the most efficient way to produce hydrogen.
Environmentalists oppose this method because it emits more methane than burning natural gas for heating. They also say hydrogen, if used to drive turbines at electric plants, produces nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that helps form ground-level ozone.
Camilla Feibelman, director of the Sierra Club's Rio Grande Chapter, said this is swapping one form of pollution for another and merely offers the industry a way to rescue its infrastructure as the world moves to renewable energy.
"This isn't [about] getting to a little better," Feibelman said. "This is getting to transformationally saving the future for our kids."
Gould indicated he sees hydrogen as complementing rather than replacing fossil fuel. Again, he said, it doesn't have to be one or the other.
Peach said there's no denying the industry funnels colossal sums into state coffers, but he noted there's a growing chorus of people who want to end the state's reliance on these revenues tied to a volatile market with booms and busts. They instead want more stable revenue sources, which can be cultivated by diversifying the economy.
Still, weaning the state off its oil dependency will be a Herculean task, Lundstrom said, and it must be done gradually over a lengthy period to avoid displacing workers.
It's easy for someone in Albuquerque or Santa Fe who doesn't work in the industry to support an upheaval, she said.
"If you're working in those oil fields, and you're supporting your family," Lundstrom said, "and all of a sudden, those [jobs] go away - what happens?"

Climate change: Just deal with it

Reality versus fantasy: Climate change is real. It has been with us for eons.
Think of droughts. The Southwest has a documented cycle of droughts. The Anasazi/Chaco culture collapsed in part due to a decadeslong megadrought. About the same time, the Mayan culture collapsed in part due to changing weather patterns, aka climate change. Six thousand years ago, the Sahara was a verdant grassland until the climate changed. The megadrought of the 1950s decimated the cattle industry in Texas and changed the culture of that state. The droughts of the 1930s and the resulting Dust Bowl caused migrations out of the Midwest to California, thus changing the cultures of both areas.
Or, there are ice ages. Europe experienced the Medieval Warm Period (950 to 1250) followed by the "little ice age" (from about 1300 to about 1850). Then there was the "year without summer," the result of the April 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies. This eruption put massive amounts of aerosols in the atmosphere, demonstrating the assertions of today's scientists about how the atmosphere affects climate. This resulted in crop failures in New England, Europe, India and China, and resulted in famine and death.
The question we should be looking at is how much our impact might be accelerating normal cyclic changes. Climate change is real, and the failure to accept this fact and deal with it is in part why the New York subway system is flooded again and New Mexico chile farmers are facing water shortages. Who is planning for next year?
That's reality. The fantasy is the unstated belief that reducing carbon emissions will return things to normal - if there ever was a normal. Humans have had a major impact on the global environment. An analogy to this delusion is the assumption that if it stops raining and flooding, my house will be dry just like before. If we achieve net-zero emissions, there will be no flooded subways, the Colorado River will flow full and the Rio Grande silvery minnow will thrive.
We need to come to grips with reality. There won't be enough water for farmers in New Mexico and Arizona. San Diego will have to suck it up and pay for desalinization of seawater while dealing with environmentalists who object to discharging brine back into the ocean. I'm not sure what will happen to Las Vegas, Nev. What will Santa Fe do when there is no water to be diverted and we've pumped the aquifer dry? One only has to look at the central valley of California for examples.
People seem to think if we just stop producing carbon dioxide, we will be saved. We don't talk about the methane from flaring oil wells because the energy industry has us focused on methane from cows. Politicians won't face the problem because it means increasing taxes for infrastructure: flood barriers, waste water treatment and desalinization plants. We hope the auto industry will solve the problem but are neglecting to ask where will all the electricity come from? Really?
Twenty years ago, I was involved in PrepCon IV as a lead-up to the Rio Conference. The big thing then was saving the rainforests. Developing countries (dictators) wanted the G7 to give them money to save their forests. Today the forests are still being clearcut, and now those countries want money to cut their carbon emissions. In 20 years, the only change has been we are talking about carbon and not trees.

Fight climate change - for justice and health

It's Earth Week - it seems a good time to celebrate Earth, learn new ways to protect our Land of Enchantment and push for nationwide progress in the fight against climate change.
We New Mexicans should be on board with fighting climate change because we are already suffering from its effects. Our state is getting hotter and drier. Summers bring more dangerous heat days; our state faces one of the highest drought threats in the nation.
As a physician, I worry about the health consequences of our changing climate. Large numbers of New Mexicans live in areas at elevated risk of wildfire. Even if you never have to flee for your life from intense flames, you are likely to be endangered by the particulate matter (soot) you may have to breathe. Particulate matter harms the lungs and contributes to strokes, heart attacks and other serious ailments. Also, extreme heat can cause heat stroke, potentially resulting in death or disability if emergency care isn't available. Heat exposure also exacerbates preexisting conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
I worry a lot about our most vulnerable populations. Children, the elderly, people with chronic diseases, low-income populations and outdoor workers are all at higher risk for heat-related illnesses. Also, it is hard to protect yourself if you live in an urban "heat island," where buildings hold the heat and the air doesn't cool off at night; or if you work in agriculture or construction; or if you can't afford air conditioning.
Fortunately, New Mexico is blessed with the right resources for fighting climate change. We are rich in sunshine, wind and geothermal energy. By developing these resources, we can generate low-cost electricity for state residents, sell excess energy to other states like California and reduce the carbon pollution that accelerates warming.
In addition, clean energy development can fight unemployment and racial injustice. The jobs and the benefits of programs like solar installation and home weatherizing can and should target low-income and high-unemployment communities. If we manufacture the components needed for wind and solar energy, we will also create factory jobs. These jobs could pay fairly and provide health insurance, advancing health and well-being for workers and their families.
Clean energy also means cleaner air, another contribution to health.
Change must happen nationwide, not just in New Mexico. In Washington, legislation is being promoted to invest clean energy infrastructure. Elected officials in Washington should take a cue from our state Legislature, which this year passed several important bills, including support for community solar, promotion of sustainable buildings, and a cross-agency Sustainable Economy Task Force to plan for a "just transition." This last part is important: A just transition will assure the development of a sustainable economy benefits everyone.
Maybe this year it will be possible. Public support for clean, healthy renewable energy is strong. Polling in the fall showed that 85 percent of Americans want to see 100 percent clean energy for America.
So this Earth Week, let's all support Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Sens. Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján, and our honorable congressional representatives, to stand strong for fighting climate change, here and in Washington. Let's promote bold, positive action to bring clean energy and a livable climate to everyone.
What a great way to celebrate Earth.

'Actionable ideas' goal for state leaders at Oct. climate summit

With a warming climate affecting everything from New Mexico's growing seasons to wildfire threats to water supplies, some state leaders, policy experts and environmentalists will meet next month to discuss possible solutions.
Dubbed the New Mexico Climate Summit, the conference slated for Oct. 25-26 at the Roundhouse will bring together diverse conservation groups, tribal leaders, professors and community activists to address the growing global crisis affecting the region.
The goal is to come away with policy ideas that can be introduced in the next legislative session and to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham so they can work together to help the state adapt and ease the impacts of climate change, said state House Speaker Brian Egolf, whose office organized the event.
"This is not meant to be sitting around and talking," said Egolf, D-Santa Fe. "We definitely want to come out of the conference with actionable ideas."
This will be the first state-level climate summit in New Mexico, Egolf added.
During breakout sessions, participants will look for ways the state can move away from fossil fuels, which will lower greenhouse gas emissions, while offering an equitable energy transition, especially for ethnic communities that have suffered more harmful effects under the current system, he said.
They'll also discuss how to better protect air, land and water and diversify the energy economy - creating family-wage jobs - in response to a changing climate.
Egolf's office is partnering with an array of organizations for this event, such as New Mexico Wild, Somos Un Pueblo Unido, the Sierra Club's Rio Grande Chapter, the Natural Resources Defense Council, OLÉ, the Center for Civic Policy, Western Resource Advocates, the Environmental Defense Fund, Conservation Voters New Mexico, Power4NewMexico, the Angelica Foundation and the Energy Foundation.
Speakers will include the governor, tribal leaders, Maite Arce of the Hispanic Access Foundation, Andrew Baumann of the Global Strategy Group, and professors from the University of New Mexico and Georgetown University.
Joey Keefe, a New Mexico Wild spokesman, said a big part of combating climate change will be to find funding, both by tapping existing sources and creating new ones.
Past lawmakers might not have viewed climate change as a priority, but there's hope the current governor and Legislature will be open to suggestions from climate advocates, including how to pay for programs, he said.
It's also vital to offer political leaders clear, science-based policy recommendations to give them a place to start, Keefe said.
"The groups that are working on these issues on a daily basis can bring to the table some sort of advice on how to take those big, broad ideas about addressing climate change and put them into actual policy solutions," he added.
Egolf said the climate crisis can't be underestimated.
"It's the most urgent, pressing problem ever faced by humanity," Egolf said. "We've got to demand action at the international and the federal level. But we can't wait for them to do everything. And we can't ignore opportunities for us to contribute here."

What if we told you this: You have nine years to live. What would you do? Would you march on with your daily routine? With your same attitude toward life? With your same priorities? Or would you have the courage to be impacted by this prognosis and change the way you live?
In 2020, the world's leading scientists issued a warning in the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fifth Assessment Report. The researchers found that "human-caused" carbon emissions needed to be cut by nearly half of 2010 levels by 2030 to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
"Worst effects of climate change?" It's hard to imagine what those might be.
Worse than the species die-off we already are seeing (as many as 200 species of plants and animals per day, according to the comprehensive report on biodiversity)? Worse than birds literally falling from the sky? Worse than the catastrophic wildfires that ravaged the West this summer - displacing thousands of people, destroying ancient old growth forest ecosystems and decimating wildlife populations? Worse than the devastating superstorms that destroyed communities in the South - costing millions in damages?
Scientists have given us a prognosis and a timeline. "Rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" are required to limit the possibility of irreversible environmental damage. Global temperatures have already risen an average of 1 degree Celsius above levels before the Industrial Age. Scientists warn that further warming will cause positive feedback loops that will lead to ecosystem collapse - acidification of the oceans, die-off of forests, melting of the Arctic, and drought and desertification that will lead to massive food shortages.
Studies show New Mexico is warming at faster rates than the global average temperature rise. Our rivers already run dry. Our forests already are diseased and dying. Our home already is threatened. What will we do?
Remember back - just one year ago to January 2020 - when COVID-19 seemed like a faraway threat in some faraway place. The idea of having to wait in food lines curving around grocery store parking lots seemed an impossibility. Think back to the normalcy we all experienced - the everyday hustle and bustle of modern-day capitalism. Even with all of its ethical contradictions, things were moving along on a regularly charted path.
Now breathe in the sweeping changes the coronavirus has forced upon us - changes and losses we have had to accept in just over 10 months. The loss of life. Isolation and social distancing. Changing our daily habits to prioritize health and safety in ways we never imagined. Massive deployments of resources, new protocols and huge demands placed on our health care system, grassroots networks of mutual aid and massive government spending packages.
We are capable of change. We are capable of courage. Our hearts may often feel like they are going to explode, but together we are capable of facing loss, of processing grief, of resilience and of healing.
This year is an opportunity for us to move forward with courage.
Our climate deadline is now just nine years. But change is in motion. The political landscape is shifting. Thanks to the hard work of organizers and voters throughout the country we have a new administration that we must push to create transformative policies. The cultural landscape is shifting, too. We have the opportunity to reckon honestly with our country's continuing history of colonization and systemic oppression, and to face the reality that we need a radical re-creation of our society's economic, social and political systems.
So as we work to address the climate emergency, we need to not only restructure our energy systems - but our entire society. We have the courage to do so. We believe you do, too.

Siberia burning, the permafrost melting, Germany flooding, fires on the West Coast, drought in the Southwest, heat wave across the globe - these should be the front-page headlines every day. What is more important? Work together to a solution, or die trying.Meredith Britt

If only
Does anybody remember former Sen. Al Gore, a Democrat from Tennessee, the climate activist, who actually had an election stolen from him on Dec. 12, 2000, by the Rehnquist Supreme Court? Had Cheney/Bush not become president, there would have been no 9/11, no Afghanistan and Iraq wars, no economic crash and five fewer clones on what is now the white supremacy court. Donald J. Trump probably still would be chasing very young women with the likes of Jeffery Epstein, Bill Clinton and Matt Gaetz.
Climate change would have been addressed starting 20 years ago, and no fascist party would have evolved to burn our Reichstag; these two items combined ended this poor, dying experiment in democracy on Jan. 6.

Stalled progress
If the director of the New Mexico Legislative Education Study Committee is indeed a bigot, that explains the consolidated Yazzie and Martinez lawsuits ("Tie vote saves administrator who disparaged Native people," Ringside Seat, July 20). The plaintiffs are supported in court by the judge saying the state has violated the education clause, the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the New Mexico Constitution - i.e., the rights of at-risk students have been violated by the state, which failed to provide them with a uniform statewide system of free public schools sufficient for their education. Doh! When will this clown car crash? "Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible." - Frank Zappa

Get the big picture
Obviously, Milan Simonich wants Legislative Education Study Committee Director Rachel Gudgel to lose her job for things she has said in the presence of/to her subordinates. To make things worse, he suggests LESC Chairman Sen. Bill Soules is pulling a fast one by barring nonvoting committee members from the executive session his committee has convened. I see no problem with that. Gudgel is not an elected official, and no amount of taxpayer money paid to an attorney to investigate her equates to advisory members and the public getting to know his findings. If The New Mexican investigated Simonich for alleged wrongdoings, I doubt the paper would publicize the findings. If the bosses did, then Simonich would not be able to work for any reputable paper other than, let's say, the Embudo Funnel Gazette. Allegations ruin a person's career. Simonich should focus his concerns on the personnel rules and procedures that govern employees of the Legislative Education Study Committee.

Demand an environmental impact report
The Forest Service is still operating on old, tired assumptions. Contrary to the assumptions that form the basis of current forest and fire management policies, we found that the forests with the most logging burned most intensely, while the forests with the highest levels of protection from logging burned least intensely. In other words, the more trees removed from the forest through logging operations, the faster and hotter the fires tend to burn. My source? Read Smoke Screen: Debunking Wildfire Myths to Save Our Forests and Our Climate by Chad T. Hanson, a research ecologist and the director of the John Muir Project of the Earth Island Institute. Go to OnceAForest.org, which is asking the Santa Fe Mountain Landscape Resiliency Project be paused. We want an environmental impact statement completed before proceeding to cut/log and burn 67 square miles in Santa Fe National Forest.

State must act on climate change before it's too late

The science is crystal clear: We have less than ten years to radically change our course or face the great consequences of our ongoing ecological destruction spanning from our extractive industries.
According to the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's best scientists say we need to drastically move toward decarbonizing our energy economy if we want a habitable planet for our future generations.
By delaying any action on climate change and its immediate threat to our lives, we are working against our own futures.
The climate crisis is real and it is impacting the lives of everyday New Mexicans in real ways. Our communities have witnessed bigger wildfires, severe water droughts, and weaker snowpacks, all of which are threatening our way of life by depleting our water sources.
In fact, according to a report published by the Union of Concerned Scientists, New Mexico's major water sources have seen a decrease of up to 37 percent, compared to the total average throughout the 20th century.
In many ways our communities feel cornered because they understand the need to address the climate crisis but are perpetually told our communities will perish unless we continue to bow down to extractive industries. It is time to take the reins of our future - we the people working and living in the belly of the beast; we who put our lives on the line to extract our natural resources; and we who have been historically abused by corporations.
Without a doubt we are at a turning point, not only in the history of New Mexico, but in terms of determining the prospect of human existence. We must act swiftly and boldly, before it is too late. And we can't continue to destroy our children's homelands and futures, only for the accumulation of wealth of a few out-of-state CEOs who could not care less about our communities.
But there is good news on the horizon. This is because New Mexico has an opportunity to be a role model to the rest of the country in how to act on climate while making sure these decisions are informed by hardworking New Mexicans. The opportunity is called House Bill 9, the New Mexico Climate Solutions Act.
HB 9 arose from the need for a just transition to a clean and healthy environment, with a thriving economy that respects our history and tradition of hard work, and one led by us - front-line communities. It is time for us to be first in line for training and access to the high-quality jobs of the future in emission and pollution reduction, and clean energy.
The Climate Solutions Act is one-of-a-kind in the nation. This bill will put us, workers who for generations have sacrificed our land and health for extractive industries, at the front of leading New Mexico's economic diversification while also addressing the root causes of the climate crisis.
For far too long, we have not been included in the decision-making of New Mexico's energy future. It is time we change that. We must commit to working for the bold, new solutions our communities deserve.
If New Mexico wants to live up to its proclaimed leadership on climate, it is time to show the nation that a healthy and clean environment does not contradict a diverse and sustainable economy. Now is the time to support and pass the Climate Solutions Act.

Smaller families could benefit N.M., the world

Across America, millions of women and couples are deciding to have smaller families. New Mexico's birth rate has also steadily declined over the past decade.
This need not be cause for alarm. In the midst of an unprecedented climate crisis and continued socioeconomic inequities, lower fertility represents an extraordinary opportunity. We can downshift and focus on creating a greater society - as opposed to a larger one.
Yet alarms are being raised that somehow our future prosperity hinges on higher birth rates. Most Americans clearly understand that's not true for their own families. And it's not true for New Mexico, nor for our nation.
Americans have managed to adapt - and often thrive - in response to vast economic changes. For example,none of today's five largest U.S. companieseven existed when the U.S. population hit 200 million in 1967. Remember when Amazon was just a river in South America? Since then, our economy has changed dramatically. Regardless of population trends, disruptions to the status quo are a fact of modern life. A stable U.S. population, with fewer people entering the workforce, could provide job opportunities for those trapped in poverty - which includes nearly 42,000 children under 18, or 21.5 percent, in the Albuquerque metro area, New Mexico's largest city. When they grow up, they deserve the chance to find great jobs.
Some worry that we won't be able to provide for older Americans without rapid population growth. Certainly, we'll need more nursing homes but fewer nursery schools. More senior transportation services but fewer school buses. More gerontologists but fewer obstetricians. Yes, the ratio of workers to retirees will shrink, but the ratio of workers to young dependents will rise as family size declines. These manageable shifts will unfold over decades and generations. In fact,demographers still project that U.S. population may rise by more than 100 million by 2100.
As family size shrinks, higher employment among working-aged women, who are still the primary caregivers, can help offset the shrinking ratio of workers to retirees. Also, smaller families make it easier toinvest more per child in terms of health and education, which is a boon to our future economic productivity. Tomorrow's jobs will demand a highly skilled workforce.
In reality, slower population growth should be seen as a breath of fresh air. And speaking of fresh air ... while our air and water are cleaner than they were 50 years ago,most Americans are still understandably worried about air and water pollution. And we are amongthe primary drivers of global climate change.
While we typically think of climate change affecting faraway places, there are serious challenges facing all of us. While the monsoon season has alleviated long-standing water shortages, drought conditions will continue. Conditions have led to a bark beetle infestation, further stressing the ponderosa pine and killing millions of piñon pines. Slower population growth would decrease the demand for the shrinking supply of freshwater in New Mexico.
In the Eastern United States, coastal communities already face"sunny day" floodingdue to climate-related sea level rise. Overbuilding, triggered by rapid population growth, in increasingly flood-prone areas is a prescription for disaster.
Economies can be adjusted to reflect our changing world. We'll have more older people and fewer younger people. We'll have more women entering and staying in the paid labor force. And we'll have more jobs carried out through automation. We can also have more green spaces and wildlife habitats, more investment in each American and more hope for a planet that can comfortably support future generations. In this situation, less can be more.

Renewable energy not a choice, but a necessity

There are a few things that I am really worried about for the future. However, one thing scares me the most above all others: Most of our world as we know it will be irreversibly changed, very possibly within this century.
This is not a good change either; we are not making some miraculous steps forward to improve standards of living. We are not morphing to live in harmony with nature. Instead we are treating the planet like a disposable napkin we can throw away should it get ruined. Except we forget that we live on that "napkin."
Scientists have been warning us for a long time that the stability of our climate is going absolutely to hell because of our actions. Most were ignored. But even if one chooses to dismiss such warnings, it is clear that something is wrong.
The frequency of record-breaking heat waves such as the one that hit the northwestern United States this summer, along with the resulting fires which brought smoke across the country, are not normal. In recent years, high temperatures and wildfires are not typical events in Siberia, nor are lethal snowstorms in Texas. We are seeing bizarre shifts in local climate norms across the world, just a few months ago Germany suffered catastrophic flooding, proving if anything that our infrastructure is not prepared for what is coming.
We know that this is happening, and we can see that changes in the climate are continuing to get more extreme every year, yet as a species we still have our heads in the sand.
The costs of ignoring what is going on are pretty clear. Not only is there a potential for extensive loss to human and natural life, which is already happening, but our standards of living will surely change. Sure we might be able to adapt, but the question I have to ask is: Do we want to live in a world like that?
Fear of what could happen needs to be a motivator, even if it is only for precaution.
I love the natural world, the wilderness and being able to experience it in familiar ways. The prospect of seeing it basically turned into a lifeless, toxic hellscape keeps me up at night. It's convenient to be dismissive and revel in the fact you'll be dead before those permanent climate change impacts take hold, but that is exactly the problem. The cause of climate change is not exclusive to the use of fossil fuels, it's the changing of ecosystems for our own use. It's the harvesting of animal and plant life to the point where it or the ecosystem can't recover. Nature, ecosystems and the balance of our planet's systems are fragile, and if people observed it for long enough they would understand that you cannot just find a quick fix and call it good enough. We played god, and we are going to suffer for it.
I see that as a species we have one very clear option. We have to make changes now so that what happens in the future is not a disaster. We need to not only drastically reverse our emissions of natural gases but place a heavy emphasis on sustainability. Resources are finite, and there is an increasingly fast-growing population on this planet.
To start with, we need to leave the ocean alone for a bit. Its ability to store carbon is probably the one thing that can even have a chance of starting to restore balance. But it needs to recover since commercial fishing has left it depleted.
Growing populations need power. It is pretty clear that burning fossil fuels like coal is not a solution, as dirty and inefficient as it is, we will also run out of it at some point. We need to find a clean, reliable long-term alternative ASAP and phase out fossil fuels.
The problem is that older generations of lawmakers act like we are not on a downward slope, and will invariably find reasons why we shouldn't do any of this. My generation has almost no real legislative power, and despite how much noise we make, it doesn't do a thing.
We don't have the luxury of time to wait. Scientists warned us it had to be done now, yet countries sit on their thumbs over nonbinding climate agreements and hand the problem off to us. When it comes to actual solutions, lawmakers seem to have cold feet.
What I want to know is, do we really have a choice in the matter? Renewables may have flaws and are not as established as fossil fuels, but it is my opinion that we need to take the lesser of two evils. Try to better develop alternative forms of energy as we go along. I would much rather live next to a reactor than the alternative path which we will find ourselves on.
Locally, we have ideal conditions in New Mexico for building wind and solar infrastructure, and hopefully we can try and pioneer further development to benefit our state's economy as well. It is the nature of politics that the industry will dig in their heels and fight to the end. But at some point we cannot depend on fossil fuels since they are jeopardizing any future we may have.

Climate change is a human issue

On the struggle for farmworker labor rights, community organizer César Chávez said: "The fight is never about grapes or lettuce. It is always about the people." One of the misconceptions about the climate crisis is that it's not a human-centered issue.
From my home in El Paso - a community bordering both Mexico and New Mexico, I can clearly see the interconnectedness of climate, immigration and health justice. On a global scale, the climate crisis is creating "climate refugees" worldwide because of increased sea levels, changing weather patterns and droughts. By 2050, 143 million people from South Asia, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa will be displaced from their homes. My hometown, which saw around 4,000 border crossings in a single day in 2019, is, and will continue to be, ground zero for this sort of climate migration from Latin America.
The crisis plays out domestically as well. Thanks to oil and gas extraction, the Permian Basin - which spans through southeastern New Mexican counties - has the highest concentration of methane emissions in the entire U.S. The levels are three orders of magnitude higher than Saudi Arabia.
In 2019, toxic wastewater from fracking operations rained down on the home of a family in Carlsbad without penalty. In New Mexico, more than 130,000 people live within a half-mile of oil and gas development. Research shows that frontline communities in this "impact zone" - commonly low-income, mixed-status, communities of color - suffer disproportionate health impacts. Counties that host the majority of oil and gas production all received "D" or "F" grades for ozone pollution from the American Lung Association.
The data about the oil and gas industry's impact on health is undeniable. Many heartbreaking, peer-reviewed studies link one's proximity to oil and gas infrastructure to adverse health impacts: higher rates of cancer at half-mile distance; higher rates of respiratory damage at 3,280-foot distance; higher rates of adverse birth outcomes at six miles; and, even higher rates of birth defects at up to 10 miles of distance.
Even people who live far from oil and gas extraction are still harmed by it. Oil and gas-prompted ozone concentrations in Lea, San Juan, Eddy and Doña Ana County (the one closest to me) are near or above the federal government's suggested limit of 70 parts per billion.
Part of the problem is that the climate crisis is ironically easy to ignore when you're trying hard not to look. Air pollutants and greenhouse gasses might be invisible to the naked eye - although organizations such as mine, Earthworks, watch industry to make these emissions visible. Nonetheless, the fossil fuel industry's impact on climate refugees and frontline communities' health is unshakably tangible.
We still have an opportunity to reimagine our economy. We can make the transition to clean, renewable energy in a just and equitable way that addresses the social, economic and racial injustices that are linked to climate change. Thankfully, New Mexico is making some progress on rules to reduce methane and other air pollution from oil and gas operations - but not enough. The chronic underfunding of environmental state agencies does not help our cause.
What we do in New Mexico will determine the fate of the climate and its victims. It's time our decision-makers think beyond the next boom-and-bust budget cycle and start addressing the human consequences of New Mexico's reliance on the fossil fuel industry.

Our View: It has to be all climate crisis, all the time

No one can say the people of Earth have not been warned.
Climate change is here, it's real and the window to stop its progression is rapidly closing.
Let's not call it climate change anymore. The planet is in the midst of a climate emergency, with the future looking hotter, drier and bleaker.
This month's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report cannot be ignored. The body of scientists convened by the United Nations spelled out in compelling detail what the future we want to avoid looks like. The report makes clear humans are the cause of global warming, with a grim conclusion. Nearly all the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century have been driven by nations burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and unloading into the atmosphere greenhouse gases that trap heat.
To save the future, nations, states, private industries and individuals must change their habits to stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
That's why the switch from burning fossil fuels for energy to renewable power is essential. It's also why New Mexico and the United States must control methane gases and other pollutants.
If we can coordinate efforts to stop carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, temperatures will rise, but not to a point that makes life unbearable. Global warming would level off, with temperatures around 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter but no more. That's not optimal. It is livable. Should global average temperatures keep rising, passing 2 degrees or 3 degrees or, heaven forbid, 4 degrees Celsius compared to the preindustrial world, the danger to humanity is exacerbated.
The report, based on 14,000 studies and approved by 195 governments, will be considered in November at a United Nations summit in Scotland to once again discuss how countries can increase efforts to reduce emissions. The goal from many world leaders, including President Joe Biden, is to limit the global rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit.
If we act quickly across the world, we can change the future.
Under Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the state has taken a number of important steps to reverse the climate emergency. An early executive order committed New Mexico to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45 percent by 2030. A landmark Energy Transition Act requires 100 percent carbon-free electricity in New Mexico by 2050. Rules to require 98 percent gas capture by 2026 and to reduce methane emissions have been adopted or are in the process of adoption. The oil and gas industry is the state's largest greenhouse gas emitter, and these rules will reduce the industry's pollution footprint.
But oil and gas is just one area the state is addressing. The second greenhouse gas emitter is transportation, and the governor has worked to increase the availability of zero- and low-emission vehicles in the state. A Clean Fuel Standard is being updated as soon as the next legislative session and the state is shoring up electric vehicle infrastructure. Cities and counties should also work with the state to improve mass transit and improve conditions for biking and walking; we need fewer cars and trucks on the road.
The governor's Interagency Climate Change Task Force meets quarterly - making climate action part of the day-to-day work in every state agency. With emissions reduced at 30 state buildings, taxpayers save $1.1 million a year in energy costs. New Mexico is focusing on building new industries to replace oil and gas so its economy can thrive. Solar tax credits are being issued - some 2,000 to businesses and individuals - and building codes have been updated to emphasize energy savings.
Cities and counties are making their own efforts, too. Among other initiatives, Santa Fe is working on making its canopy of trees more resilient; along with that work, there must be more emphasis on planting water-wise trees across private and public property. That means emphasizing rain catchment and water storage so these trees have an opportunity to live.
Local governments should have their own climate task forces and should talk to one another so we are working together toward a common goal. All decisions must be seen through the lens of the looming climate crisis.
The news is grim, but enough time remains - just barely - to write a different future.

Teresa Seamster said she is usually fine with cutting down her beetle-infested piñons because it keeps the pests from spreading to healthy trees.
But she recalled mourning the loss of three majestic roadside trees that had to be felled.
"One had a big hawk's nest in it," said Seamster, who lives in the Los Vaqueros area south of Santa Fe. "It was just sad to see this big gap where you used [to] see all these beautiful trees."
Bark beetle infestations are among the effects of the state's prolonged drought, which is stressing trees throughout the region, from semi-rural neighborhoods to urban areas to forests.
Dehydrated trees can't produce the resin that's a natural pest repellent - a sort of double whammy in a drought.
Arborists, foresters, state and local governments, and residents like Seamster are working to counter the drought's impacts on trees. But it promises to be an endless battle as researchers predict climate change will create warmer, drier weather in the coming years throughout the Southwest.
The piñon pine, New Mexico's official state tree, is especially vulnerable. Harsh drought conditions led to an estimated 350 million piñons dying statewide in the early 2000s and millions more dying a decade later, leaving desolate gaps in the landscape.
Tree experts worry that an unrelenting drought could cause another enormous tree die-off, and not just piñon. Large expanses of ponderosa pine are yellowing from drought stress in wooded areas.
"If drought conditions continue on this path or get worse, it's very likely we'll have another event like that," said John Formby, an entomologist at the state Forestry Division.
Grappling with drought
The state has been in a mostly dry period since the late 1990s.
Last year's snowpack and monsoon were exceptionally light, pushing the Rio Grande to its lowest level in years. The depleted river threatened to shut down the Buckman Direct Diversion in Santa Fe for the first time in the treatment plant's decadelong history.
This winter is one of the driest in recent memory, compounded by La Niña, an ocean cooling event that reduces evaporation and results in even drier conditions in the Southwest.
Climatologists say hotter and more arid conditions will be the norm, with cooler, wetter cycles becoming shorter and less frequent.
It all adds up to thirstier trees that are more prone to pest invasions.
Higher-elevation trees, such as Douglas firs, white firs and spruce, transplanted in lower altitudes won't fare as well during an intense drought, Formby said.
Higher altitudes are cooler and moister, making the native species less able to withstand harsher conditions at lower elevation, he said.
Although piñons are indigenous to the Southwest and can survive on 6 to 8 inches of annual rainfall, the past year has yielded less precipitation than that in some areas.
Santa Fe County is ranked as being in extreme drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
"Piñon pines are doing very poorly, and they're expected to do very poorly under climate change," said Peggy Darr, an open space resource management specialist for Santa Fe County.
Intense droughts devastated piñons in 2002 and 2013. The first die-off happened because of a bark beetle onslaught, and the second die-off, which was less catastrophic, came from an ips beetle attack.
The piñons that survived might be a sturdier breed better able to withstand an extended drought, but that's difficult to predict, Formby said.
The severe dry heat is turning ponderosa pines yellow in forests throughout the state, Formby said.
A tree's canopy turning yellow prematurely is a sign of stress, usually from heat, lack of water, pests or all those factors, Formby said.
Last year, the canopies of cottonwoods lining the Santa Fe River turned yellow in early August, weeks ahead of the normal color change. Arborists attributed the early withering to the river running drier than normal, depriving the riparian trees of water for their root systems.
However, if cottonwoods drop their leaves early once, it would not be a problem, so it will be important to see what happens this year, said Guy Meilleur, a consulting arborist with Historic Tree Care.
A lightened color in a tree isn't always a sign of deterioration, Meilleur said.
"Bronzing is a seasonal color change that junipers have," Meilleur said. "Some people see the color going yellowish in the winter, and they're afraid for the tree. But that's a natural defense against the cold."
Formby said junipers are one of the most durable trees in an arid region.
"Junipers are pretty drought resistant," Formby said. "So my least concern would be junipers."
Still, a 2015 study conducted by Los Alamos National Laboratory found that increasingly warm and dry Southwest weather, driven by climate change, would lead to widespread piñon and juniper deaths in New Mexico by 2050 and could wipe out the populations by 2100 if preventive measures aren't taken.
When entire piñon stands are wiped out - as they were in the past - they don't return, he said. Juniper and cactus have grown into the clearings that once contained piñon forests, he said.
That's why it's important to give piñons and other trees a fighting chance, Formby said.
What is being done
The county oversees 6,600 acres of open space, much of it woodlands with trees vulnerable to drought.
With mixed-conifer stands, crews thin the trees to limit the spread of pests and cultivate fewer and larger trees that are more resilient to climate change, Darr said.
In piñon forests, crews plant seeds on slopes facing north and east so the growing trees avoid baking in the afternoon sun, she said.
They also install straw-filled tubes near some piñons to catch runoff that the trees can absorb, Darr said.
Hydrating the piñons generates more seeds for piñon jays to collect and spread, sprouting more of the trees, Darr said.
"This will allow our piñon forests and piñon jays to thrive into the future under harsher climate change scenarios," she said.
Caring for trees is more challenging but important in cities to reduce urban heat islands, Formby said, referring to how those settings are hotter because of sparser landscaping, less natural shade and heat radiating from pavement and buildings.
Meilleur said he works with arborists on a method that involves aerating the soil around roots and filling the holes with a structural material. The work has been done with trees on the Santa Fe Plaza and in regional parks and woodlands, he said.
When pruning trees, cut as few branches as possible, Meilleur said. Branches should be cut back just enough to clear a road or structure, and they should never be lopped off near the trunk, he said, because that exposes the inner tree to heat.
People shouldn't compound the stress that trees are already under in the drought, Meilleur said.
Pests have been more invasive in the past year on private lands, partly because those tracts are at a lower elevation than most national forests, making them hotter and drier, according to a state Forestry Division report.
That certainly has been the case in Seamster's neighborhood, where pests have been a nuisance for at least a decade.
Seamster said she regularly walks her property to check on the piñons. If one looks sickly, she knows it has been infested and has it chopped down to prevent spread.
She sprays her trees with a nontoxic pesticide mixed with water, which has the added benefit of hydrating them, she said.
Her vigilance has paid off. Nearly all her trees are healthy and bug-free. That ensures she won't have to relive the experience of cutting down 1,000 infested trees, as she and her husband did after they moved there a decade ago, she said.
The tree casualties included the three big piñons near the road and a large one on their property's ridge that was painful to see removed, she said.
She knows fighting pests is the new reality with a changing climate, she said.
"You're never going to get rid of bark beetles now," Seamster said.

We don't hear much good news on climate change these days.
A recent report from one of the world's largest insurance providers, Swiss Re, estimates the effects of climate change will reduce global economic output 10 percent to 14 percent by 2050 on our current trajectory. That's around $23 trillion in lost economic output every year.
And that is not the worst-case scenario. If we continue to expand our use of fossil fuels, Swiss Re estimates that developing countries, especially those with extensive coastlines, could see their economic output drop by almost half.
To put this in context: The global economy shrank by an estimated 4.9 percent in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and is expected to rebound by 5.4 percent in 2021, according to the International Monetary Fund. Permanently losing 11 percent to 50 percent of economic output would be an economic catastrophe.
However, one cause for optimism is that Wall Street is beginning to take the threat of environmental devastation seriously. If the world is poorer, then companies stand to make less profit.
Many corporations, especially insurance companies, see the dramatic impact climate change will have on their bottom line. And, ultimately, no industry will be able to avoid the looming economic repercussions of rising sea levels, rampant wildfires or Arctic cold snaps.
Recognizing the imminent danger, some of the world's most influential companies are adopting a new tone. They are lining up behind the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, making zero-carbon pledges or joining organizations like the Council for Inclusive Capitalism.
Beyond mere lip service, these meaningful changes in corporate behavior toward a zero-carbon economy are a necessary next step.
Investment managers have also taken heed of climate change. One out of every 3 dollars under professional management in the U.S. is invested according to sustainable investing strategies, according to the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment.
Moreover, the amount of capital flowing into sustainable investments is increasing each year exponentially.
This trend is driven by growing evidence that sustainable investing can go head to head with conventional investing - offering competitive returns with less volatility risk. More than 2,200 studies of financial markets over the past two decades have shown that environmental, social and corporate governance criteria can be key factors in achieving superior investment results.
For example, a Bank of America/Merrill Lynch study showed that stocks ranked within the top third by ESG scores outperformed stocks in the bottom third by a whopping 18 percentage points from 2005-15. Investors are waking up to the reality that ESG metrics are as crucial to consider as conventional considerations.
The bottom line is that sustainability is good for the bottom line. That's good news for conscious investors, but it may be even better news for the health of our planet.
Moralizing, sermonizing and even scientific data have thus far failed to sway many Americans about the perils of climate change. However, the stick of economic apocalypse and the carrot of potentially better risk-adjusted returns may accomplish what appeals to conscience and reason have not.
By all means, go out and protest the destruction of the planet. And vote for the Green New Deal at the ballot. But make sure to vote with your dollars as well.
One of the simplest ways you can help tip the balance is by ensuring your portfolio is managed according to socially responsible investment criteria. Please invest sustainably so we can all protect the future we are investing for.

Governor signs order to preserve 30% of public lands

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order Wednesday that calls for 30 percent of New Mexico's public lands to be protected by 2030, putting the state in line with a larger federal conservation effort.
The order directs a half-dozen state agencies to coalesce behind the "30 by 30" plan by establishing programs that conserve, protect and enhance public lands for a variety of uses. An additional 20 percent will be designated as climate stabilization areas.
The state will form a committee, representing diverse stakeholders, to look at areas that should be conserved to avoid watershed degradation, meet climate goals and protect both wildlife habitat and migration corridors.
"There is no future without maintaining our watersheds, our land, our forests, and doing that in a way that is responsible and that will last for generations to come," Lujan Grisham said before signing the order outside the Roundhouse.
A broad coalition applauded the order, including environmentalists, tribal leaders, local governments and outdoor recreation advocates.
The directive aligns with President Joe Biden's "America the Beautiful" initiative that seeks to conserve and restore 30 percent of the country's lands by 2030.
The consensus among those who back the plan is that stepping up protections to enhance biodiversity is crucial as climate change, development and population growth put increasing stress on land, waterways and wildlife.
They say steps to conserve lands from degradation - especially watersheds and wildlife migration corridors - is crucial to the state's future.
But some Republican state leaders criticized the plan, calling it more government overreach.
"Almost half of all land in New Mexico is already owned and controlled by the state or the federal government, and we all know that our family-owned, private land is better managed, utilized, and preserved," state Sen. Crystal Diamond, R-Elephant Butte, said in a statement.
"This 30 x 30 initiative set forth by the governor is a thinly veiled land grab and the people of New Mexico will not stand for it," Diamond said.
Still, the order states farming, ranching and other "working lands" also face dire threats from climate-induced drought and could benefit from protections. The state will work to foster responsible stewardship with diverse activities, whether it's outdoor recreation or traditional uses such as agriculture, the order says.
"Protecting and conserving land will expand access to the outdoors for recreation, hunting, fishing," said Demis Foster, executive director of Conservation Voters of New Mexico, speaking at the ceremony. "This order also provides additional opportunities for partnerships with private landowners that want to do more conservation work on their land."
Agencies are instructed to use the best available science and take a wide view of conservation, including the value of working lands. They also must consider tribal sovereignty and ensure environmental equity among all communities.
The agencies taking part include the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department; the state Department of Game and Fish; Indian Affairs; the Office of the State Engineer; the Department of Agriculture; and the state Environment Department.
They will meet quarterly to assess the state's progress and submit a yearly report to the governor.
Several supporters interviewed after the ceremony said the order is vital for bolstering climate resiliency.
"We're currently facing an extinction crisis," said Jesse Deubel, executive director of New Mexico Wildlife Federation. "The 30 by 30 initiative ... provides solutions and opportunities to stop the destruction of critical habitat and stabilize our climate by preserving natural landscapes."
Deubel said he will monitor the committee to make sure expanded conservation doesn't exclude hunting and fishing, which the group deems high priority.
Garrett VeneKlasen, northern conservation director for New Mexico Wild, said it's important the state's land conservation mirrors the governor's other policies to combat climate change.
"With the coming challenges that we're having with climate change, if our watersheds are not resilient, conserved and restored and functional to their highest value ... then we're really going to suffer as a state," VeneKlasen said.
One conservation advocate said the hunting and fishing component must remain strong to maintain bipartisan support for the plan.
"Obviously sportsmen, hunters, anglers, we have a lot at stake," said John Cornell, southwest field manager for Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.
Cornell said he was pleased to hear the governor address the need to protect migration corridors, which are critical for the health of elk and deer.
If lands aren't managed smartly as the climate changes, wildlife will decline and watersheds will dry up, Cornell said.
"We all know what kind of problems we're going to have," Cornell said. "We're already having shortages in a megadrought."
